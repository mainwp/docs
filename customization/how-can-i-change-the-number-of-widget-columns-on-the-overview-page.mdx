The fixed widget column setting was removed in MainWP Dashboard version 4.5. Widgets are now fully resizable and can be arranged freely on the Overview page.

## What Changed

In earlier versions, you could select a fixed number of columns (1, 2, 3, or 4) for the Overview page layout. This setting was replaced with flexible widgets that you can resize to any width.

## How to Resize Widgets

Drag the edges or corners of any widget to resize it. Widgets automatically snap to a grid and reflow around each other.
