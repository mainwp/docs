<Step title="Access phpMyAdmin">
Log in to your child site's cPanel, Plesk, or hosting control panel and open phpMyAdmin (or a similar database management tool).
</Step>
<Step title="Select the database">
Navigate to and select the database for your child site.
</Step>
<Step title="Open SQL tab">
Click on the **SQL** tab to enter custom queries.
</Step>
<Step title="Run the delete command">
Paste and execute this SQL command:

```sql
DELETE FROM `wp_options` WHERE option_name LIKE '%mainwp_%'

Click **Go** to run the query. The command removes all MainWP-related entries from the options table.
