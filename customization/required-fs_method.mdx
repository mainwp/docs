  MainWP requires the Filesystem Method to be set to direct on Child Sites for
  updates to work properly. Add the FS_METHOD constant to wp-config.php.

WordPress supports multiple filesystem access methods for installing and updating plugins and themes. MainWP requires the "direct" method to function properly on child sites.

## What You'll Learn

- Why FS_METHOD matters for MainWP
- How to configure the setting
- How to troubleshoot file permission issues

---

## Why This Setting Matters

WordPress can access the filesystem through several methods:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **direct** | PHP directly reads and writes files |
| **ssh2** | Uses SSH connection for file operations |
| **ftpext** | Uses PHP's FTP extension |
| **ftpsockets** | Uses FTP via sockets |

MainWP needs direct filesystem access to perform updates, install plugins/themes, and manage files efficiently. When WordPress uses FTP or SSH methods, MainWP operations may timeout or fail.

---

## When You Need This Setting

Apply this setting if you experience:

- MainWP Dashboard warnings about filesystem method
- Plugin or theme updates failing with permission errors
- Upload operations timing out
- "Could not create directory" errors during installations

---

## How to Apply the Setting

<Steps>
<Step title="Connect to your Child Site">
Use FTP, SFTP, or your hosting file manager to access the site files.
</Step>
<Step title="Open wp-config.php">
Locate and open the `wp-config.php` file in the site root directory.
</Step>
<Step title="Add the FS_METHOD constant">
Add this line before the comment `/* That's all, stop editing! */`:

```php
define( 'FS_METHOD', 'direct' );
```
</Step>
<Step title="Save and test">
Save the file and test by running an update from your MainWP Dashboard.
</Step>
</Steps>

## File Permissions

For direct filesystem access to work, WordPress needs proper file permissions:

| Item | Recommended Permission |
|------|----------------------|
| Directories | 755 |
| Files | 644 |
| wp-config.php | 640 or 600 |

If you've set FS_METHOD to direct but still encounter issues, check that your hosting account owns the files and directories.

---

## Alternative: FTP Configuration

Some managed hosts don't allow direct filesystem access. In those cases, configure FTP credentials instead:

```php
define( 'FTP_USER', 'your-ftp-username' );
define( 'FTP_PASS', 'your-ftp-password' );
define( 'FTP_HOST', 'ftp.yoursite.com' );
```

See the [WordPress documentation on filesystem constants](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/wordpress/wp-config/#wordpress-upgrade-constants) for complete options.

## Troubleshooting

If setting FS_METHOD doesn't resolve issues:

1. Verify file ownership matches your PHP process user
2. Check if your host restricts certain PHP functions
3. Review the [Required PHP Functions](/advanced/miscellaneous/required-php-functions-for-mainwp) list
4. Contact your hosting support for assistance with file permissions

## Self-Check Checklist

- [ ] FS_METHOD constant added to wp-config.php
- [ ] File saved successfully
- [ ] Test update runs without errors
- [ ] File permissions set correctly (755/644)
