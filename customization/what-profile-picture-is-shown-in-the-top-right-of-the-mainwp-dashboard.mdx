## How the Avatar is Selected

If **Show Avatars** is disabled on your Dashboard site, a generic user icon appears.

**Location:** WP Admin > Settings > Discussion

### 2. Gravatar Linked

If **Show Avatars** is enabled and your email address is linked to a [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/) account, your Gravatar image displays.

**Location:** WP Admin > Users > Profile

### 3. Default Avatar

If you don't have a Gravatar, WordPress displays the default avatar selected in Discussion settings.
