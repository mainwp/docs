  Change the sender address for MainWP email notifications using a PHP filter
  without affecting your WordPress administration email address.

By default, MainWP uses the **Administration Email Address** from your WordPress General Settings for email notifications. You can change the FROM address specifically for MainWP emails without modifying that WordPress setting.

## What You'll Learn

- How to customize the FROM address for MainWP emails
- How to change it for specific email types only

## Prerequisites

- [Custom Dashboard extension](/add-ons/development/mainwp-custom-dashboard-extension) (free)

---

## Default Behavior

MainWP uses the email address configured in **WP Admin > Settings > General** under **Administration Email Address**.

## Change FROM Address for Specific Emails Only

To customize the sender only for certain MainWP emails (e.g., Daily Digest), use this conditional version:

```php
add_filter( 'mainwp_send_mail_from_header', 'myhook_mainwp_send_mail_from_header', 10, 3 );
function myhook_mainwp_send_mail_from_header( $input, $email, $subject ) {
    // Only change FROM for specific email/subject combinations
    if ( 'recipient@example.com' == $email && 'Daily Digest' == $subject ) {
        return array(
            'from_name'  => 'Custom Name',
            'from_email' => 'custom@example.com',
        );
    }
    // Return original for all other emails
    return $input;
}
```

Adjust the `$email` and `$subject` conditions to match the emails you want to customize.
