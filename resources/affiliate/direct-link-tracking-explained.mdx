Direct Link Tracking allows you to link directly to our site without additional parameters in the URL. For example, instead of: https://mainwp.com/ref/2 you can use https://mainwp.com (or any internal MainWP page such as a specific Extension).

## How it works

When a visitor comes to MainWP from your site, MainWP can see the URL of the referring website by checking the HTTP_REFERER information sent by the browser.  Most modern browsers send this information.

## Direct Link advantages

This kind of linking has several advantages:

-   **The link does not appear to be an affiliate link** Most people will not click on a link they recognize as an affiliate link. When you use affiliate links on your site, visitors will know that you earn commissions for promoting MainWP and may be less likely to believe in your review and click on the link.  Direct Link Tracking removes that perceived bias.
-   **Visitors cannot remove your affiliate parameters**. Again, there are people who will not purchase through affiliate links, even if there is no disadvantage for them.

Remember to provide proper affiliate disclosure where it is required by law. If you're unsure of your local laws, please consult an attorney.

## How to use it

To use Direct Link Tracking, you have to [set up your URLs in the Direct Link section](https://mainwp.com/my-account/affiliate-area/?tab=settings#dl) of the Affiliate area. These are URL addresses of **YOUR** sites, where you'll place your links to MainWP.  These **may not include social networks** (Facebook, Twitter, and others) for promotion of MainWP on social networks; see [Social Network Promotion](/resources/affiliate/affiliate-faqs), or use your standard affiliate link. All URLs will be manually reviewed and approved or denied. You will be sent a notification email when a decision has been made. Direct Linking will not work before your URL is approved. Once your URL is approved, every link to MainWP (even without affiliate parameters) from that page will be treated as a referral.
