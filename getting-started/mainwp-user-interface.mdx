The MainWP Dashboard provides a centralized interface for managing all your connected WordPress sites. Understanding the layout, widgets, navigation, and table controls allows you to work efficiently across hundreds of sites.

## What You Will Accomplish

After reviewing this page, you will be able to:

- Customize widget layout and visibility on overview pages
- Navigate between global and individual site views
- Sort, filter, and act on data in MainWP tables
- Select sites for bulk actions using the Select Sites metabox

## Prerequisites

- MainWP Dashboard installed and activated on your Dashboard site
- At least one Child Site connected (see [Getting started with MainWP](/getting-started/get-started-with-mainwp))

<Note>
If you upgraded from a MainWP version before 4.5 and see visual issues, perform a hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R on Windows, Command + Shift + R on Mac) or clear your browser cache.
</Note>

## Widgetized Pages

MainWP overview pages display multiple widgets that summarize your Child Sites and the actions needed to maintain them. You can customize the layout to match your workflow.

### Reorder Widgets

Drag and drop widgets to customize their order. MainWP Dashboard remembers your arrangement for future visits.

### Sites Changes (Insights)

![Sites Changes widget showing recent activity log](/images/getting-started/ui-sites-changes-widget.jpg)

The Sites Changes widget tracks recent activity including changes made outside MainWP and those made from your Dashboard. Each entry includes the event type, action taken, timestamp, website, and user responsible. Filter options at the top let you view Non-MainWP changes only, Dashboard-made changes only, or both.

### Recent Posts

MainWP Dashboard also provides page navigation tabs that vary by section. Each MainWP section has different page navigation options, and some sections have no tabs.

## Tables

MainWP uses DataTables for advanced interaction controls throughout the interface.

![DataTables interface showing sortable columns and pagination](/images/getting-started/ui-datatable-interface.jpg)

### Actions Menu

![Actions menu in table row](/images/getting-started/ui-actions-menu.jpg)

The actions menu appears in the far right column of most MainWP tables.

### Sorting Options

![Table column header with sorting arrows](/images/getting-started/ui-table-sorting.jpg)

Click any column header to sort table data by that column.

### Columns Order

Drag and drop columns to set a custom order. MainWP remembers your arrangement, so this adjustment persists across page loads.

### Bulk Actions

![Bulk actions dropdown menu above table](/images/getting-started/ui-bulk-actions.jpg)

The bulk action menu appears in the top-left position above tables. Select items, choose an action from the dropdown, and click **Apply**.

### Table Filter

![Table filter options in top-right corner](/images/getting-started/ui-table-filters.jpg)

Use the filters in the top-right to narrow down table data.

### Pagination

![Table pagination controls](/images/getting-started/ui-table-pagination.jpg)

When tables contain more data than a single page can display, pagination controls allow you to navigate through the data.

## Manage Plugins and Themes Table Features

![Manage Plugins & Themes table features](/images/getting-started/ui-manage-plugins-table.png)

The Manage Plugins and Manage Themes tables include icons for quicker identification and display the number of child sites where each plugin or theme is installed. You can select child sites individually or select all sites where a particular plugin or theme is installed. Plugins and themes can be activated, deactivated, or deleted individually or in bulk.

## Select Sites

The Select Sites metabox appears throughout MainWP and determines which Child Sites an action affects. Common uses include searching for content, publishing posts, and installing plugins or themes.

![Select Sites metabox with site selection checkboxes](/images/getting-started/ui-select-sites-metabox.jpg)

Check the box next to a Child Site name to include it. Disconnected sites appear disabled because MainWP Dashboard cannot update sites that lack a proper connection.

### Selection Methods

| Method | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| By Site | Select individual sites directly |
| By Tag | Select all sites assigned to specific tags |
| By Client | Select all sites associated with specific clients |

### Quick Selection

The **All** and **None** buttons above the site list provide fast selection or deselection.

### Sites Filter

Type a site name in the filter field at the top of the metabox to locate specific sites quickly. This feature proves especially useful when managing many Child Sites.

## Sidebar Accordion

The MainWP Sidebar contains collapsible sections with different option groups. Common sections include Select Sites, search parameters, and action buttons at the bottom.

![Sidebar accordion with collapsible sections](/images/getting-started/ui-sidebar-accordion.jpg)

Collapse sections you use less frequently to keep the interface clean, and expand them when needed.

## Individual Site Mode

Most MainWP features work at both global level (affecting all Child Sites) and individual site level.

### Single Site Overview

Individual Child Site mode lets you control settings per site and monitor site-specific data.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Manage Sites">
Go to **MainWP > Sites > Manage Sites**.
</Step>
<Step title="Select a site">
Locate the Child Site and click its name under the **Site** column.
</Step>
</Steps>

The overview page includes these tabs:

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| Overview | Site-specific information and actions |
| Edit | Modify Child Site settings |
| Updates | Manage available updates |
| Email Settings | Configure email notifications |
| Site Hardening | View security issues and reports |

Installed MainWP Add-ons display additional tabs as applicable.

## Page Settings

Most MainWP Dashboard pages include a **Page Settings** button in the top-right corner. These settings apply to the specific page where you configure them.

![Page Settings](/images/getting-started/ui-page-settings.png)

## Custom Event Monitor

The Custom Event Monitor logs system events and helps with troubleshooting. Access it from **MainWP > Info**.

![Custom Event Monitor log interface](/images/getting-started/ui-event-monitor.jpg)

<Note>
The Custom Event Monitor remains in alpha phase with a limited number of tracked actions. Coverage will expand in future releases.
</Note>
