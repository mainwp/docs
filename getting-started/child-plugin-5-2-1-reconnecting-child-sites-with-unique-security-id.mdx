  MainWP Child plugin version 5.2.1 enables the Unique Security ID feature by
  default. Learn how to reconnect child sites that require the Security ID by
  retrieving it from the Child plugin settings and updating your Dashboard.
---

Starting with MainWP Child plugin version 5.2.1, the Unique Security ID feature is enabled by default. This security enhancement requires entering the Security ID when connecting or reconnecting child sites.

## What You'll Learn

- Understand why the Security ID is required
- Retrieve the Security ID from a child site
- Enter the Security ID in your Dashboard
- Find the Security ID when the Child plugin is hidden

## Prerequisites

- MainWP Dashboard installed and activated
- MainWP Child plugin version 5.2.1 or later on child sites
- Admin access to both Dashboard and child sites

---

## Why This Happens

When connecting or reconnecting a child site with Security ID enabled, you'll see this error:

> This child site is set to require a unique security ID. Please enter it before the connection can be established.

The Security ID is re-enabled automatically if:

- MainWP Child version 5.2.1 is installed fresh
- The Child plugin is deactivated and reactivated

<Note>
This behavior is specific to version 5.2.1. Later versions may handle Security ID differently.
