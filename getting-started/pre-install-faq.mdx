## Most Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is MainWP?" icon="circle-info" defaultOpen>
    MainWP is a free and open-source WordPress management system that lets you manage multiple WordPress sites from one self-hosted Dashboard.

    The MainWP system consists of three parts:

    - **MainWP Dashboard plugin** — Install this on a dedicated WordPress site. This is your control center for managing all connected sites.
    - **MainWP Child plugin** — Install this on each site you want to manage. It creates a secure connection to your Dashboard.
    - **MainWP Extensions** — Optional add-ons for backups, marketing, SEO, maintenance, security, monitoring, and other tools.

    The Dashboard and Child plugins are required. Extensions are entirely optional and extend what your Dashboard can do.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does MainWP work on WordPress.com?" icon="globe" defaultOpen>
    No, the MainWP system is for self-hosted WordPress sites only. WordPress.com sites cannot install custom plugins required for MainWP to function.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is MainWP secure?" icon="shield-halved" defaultOpen>
    Security is one of our top priorities at MainWP. We are active participants in the white-hat hacking site [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/), which has security researchers continually testing our plugins.

    MainWP is also self-hosted, meaning your data stays on your own servers—we never have access to your sites or actions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What hosts do you recommend?" icon="server" defaultOpen>
    We recommend the [Pressable MainWP Install](https://mainwp.com/pressable/), but MainWP works on most hosts that support WordPress and meet the minimum requirements.

    Check our [host compatibility page](/advanced/miscellaneous/hosting-compatibility) to see if your host has any known issues.

## Understanding MainWP

Learn about the MainWP system, its components, and how it differs from other WordPress management solutions.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What does self-hosted mean?" icon="house-laptop">
    Your MainWP Dashboard is hosted on your own WordPress installation, not on our servers. We do not keep records of your actions, sites, or any other data.

    With MainWP, **privacy is paramount**—you maintain complete control over your data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I install MainWP?" icon="download">
    Follow the step-by-step instructions in these guides:

    - [Get started with MainWP](/getting-started/get-started-with-mainwp)
    - [Manage Extensions](/dashboard/overview/manage-extensions)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize MainWP plugins or extensions?" icon="code">
    We do not recommend direct customization of MainWP core code, and we do not support modified installations.

    If you want to build your own extension or hire someone to do so, our developer documentation is available at [MainWP Codex](https://mainwp.dev/).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can MainWP handle thousands of sites?" icon="sitemap">
    You can manage an unlimited number of child sites. However, how many sites a single Dashboard can control depends on your hosting quality.

    Review the [system requirements](/advanced/miscellaneous/mainwp-system-requirements) for more information on optimizing your setup.

## Extensions & Licensing

How extensions work, licensing terms, updates, and usage policies.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do plugins and extensions have licenses?" icon="file-contract">
    All extensions are licensed under the GPL, just like WordPress. Extensions can be used on unlimited sites.

    Support and update licenses are separate and valid for the duration of your MainWP membership (Monthly, Yearly, or Lifetime).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are licenses valid for a lifetime?" icon="infinity">
    Support and update licenses are valid for the duration of your MainWP Pro membership:

    - **Monthly/Yearly plans** — Valid as long as your subscription is active
    - **Lifetime plan** — Never expires
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when my license expires?" icon="calendar-xmark">
    For Monthly or Yearly memberships, licenses renew automatically with each payment.

    The Lifetime membership does not expire.

    If you cancel, extensions continue working with the last version you had—you just lose access to updates and support.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does it cost to renew my license?" icon="rotate">
    If you cancel and later want to rejoin, you'll pay the current price at that time. If prices have increased, you'll pay the higher rate.
  </Accordion>

    Extensions auto-authorize based on activated extensions in your account. You can activate and deactivate your license key as many times as needed.

    Update extensions the same way you update any WordPress plugin: go to **Plugins** in your WP Admin and check for updates. See the [extension management FAQ](/dashboard/overview/manage-extensions#update-extensions) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use an extension on multiple Dashboards?" icon="clone">
    Yes. Extensions are installed on the MainWP Dashboard (not child sites), and you can install them on as many Dashboards as you have.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use extensions for client sites?" icon="users">
    Yes. You're welcome to use our extensions for client work without violating our license.

    The Dashboard, Child plugin, and all extensions are licensed under the same GPL as WordPress.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do extensions work with WordPress Multisite?" icon="network-wired">
