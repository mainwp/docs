MainWP stable releases include no telemetry or phone-home functionality. Your Dashboard operates independently on your own server, and no data is transmitted to MainWP.

## Free Plugins: Zero Data Collection

The free MainWP Dashboard and Child plugins include no telemetry or tracking. MainWP does not know who installs these plugins or where they are installed. No data is collected, transmitted, or stored.

## Add-on License Verification

If you purchase MainWP Add-ons, your MainWP Dashboard domain name and IP address are collected periodically to verify license ownership and API key validity. Child site information is never collected. This data is required for license verification and is collected only from users who purchase add-ons.

## Early Access Telemetry

MainWP v6 Early Access builds include optional, limited telemetry to help improve the product before stable release. This telemetry can be disabled at any time. See [MainWP Telemetry (Early Access)](/advanced/miscellaneous/mainwp-telemetry-early-access) for details on what is collected.
