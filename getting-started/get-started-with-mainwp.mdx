[← Part 1: MainWP Introduction](/getting-started/mainwp-introduction)

[Part 3: MainWP User Interface →](/getting-started/mainwp-user-interface)

MainWP requires two components:
- **MainWP Dashboard** - Install on a dedicated WordPress site that controls all other sites
- **MainWP Child** - Install on each WordPress site you want to manage

<Warning>
Install MainWP Dashboard on a clean WordPress installation rather than an operating site. This eliminates plugin conflicts.
</Warning>

MainWP has no site limit. Check the [System Requirements](/advanced/miscellaneous/mainwp-system-requirements) to verify your server can handle your planned number of child sites.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, confirm you have:

- A dedicated WordPress site for the MainWP Dashboard (not an existing production site)
- Administrator access to the Dashboard site
- Administrator access to each child site you want to manage
- MainWP Child plugin ready to install on child sites
