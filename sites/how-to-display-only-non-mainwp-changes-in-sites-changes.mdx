The Site Changes feature tracks all modifications to your child sites, including updates performed through your Dashboard and changes made directly in child site WP Admin areas. Filtering for Non-MainWP Changes lets you identify what happened on sites outside of your Dashboard control.

## What You'll Accomplish

- Filter the Site Changes widget to show only direct WP Admin changes
- Filter the Site Changes page to exclude Dashboard-initiated updates
- Monitor unauthorized or unexpected modifications to your sites

## Prerequisites

- MainWP Dashboard with connected child sites
- MainWP Child Reports plugin active on child sites (tracks changes)
- Some recent activity on child sites to view

---

## What Are Non-MainWP Changes?

MainWP tracks two types of changes:

| Change Type | Source | Examples |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| MainWP Changes | Performed via Dashboard | Bulk plugin updates, theme installations, content publishing |
| Non-MainWP Changes | Made directly in child site WP Admin | Manual plugin updates, settings changes, content edits by site editors |

Filtering for Non-MainWP Changes helps you identify when someone accessed a child site directly and made modifications without going through your Dashboard.

## Common Use Cases

### Monitor Client Activity

When clients have WP Admin access to their sites, filter for Non-MainWP Changes to see what modifications they made without your involvement.

### Security Auditing

Unexpected Non-MainWP Changes may indicate unauthorized access. Review these changes to verify they were made by authorized users.

### Troubleshooting

If a site breaks after changes you didn't make, filter Non-MainWP Changes to identify what was modified directly on the site.
