Yes, MainWP includes a rollback feature for plugin and theme updates. Introduced in MainWP version 5.1, this feature integrates with WordPress core rollback functionality available in WordPress 6.3 and above.

## How Safe Updates Work

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Activation | Automatically active on all update pages |
| Trigger | Activates when an update fails |
| Action | Restores the previous version automatically |
| Notification | Dashboard displays a notice when rollback occurs |

## Requirements

- MainWP Dashboard 5.1 or higher
- Child sites running WordPress 6.3 or higher

## Manual Rollback

MainWP does not support on-demand rollback to previous versions. However, you can:

1. Download previous plugin versions from wordpress.org
2. Install via [Upload](/sites/plugins/managing-plugins-with-mainwp#install-by-upload)
3. Store premium plugins in the [Favorites Extension](https://mainwp.com/extension/favorites/) for future use

## Additional Testing

The [Regression Testing](/add-ons/security/regression-testing-extension) add-on monitors your child sites for unexpected changes after updates, providing an additional layer of protection.
