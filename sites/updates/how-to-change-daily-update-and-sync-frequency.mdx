## How Timing Works

If you set:
- **Automatic daily sync time**: 7:00 AM
- **Daily update frequency**: 3 times per day

MainWP will sync and check for updates at:
- 7:00 AM
- 3:00 PM (8 hours later)
- 11:00 PM (8 hours later)

---

## Important Notes

- Automatic updates only apply to items marked as **Trusted**
- Updates may take up to 24 hours after MainWP detects a new version
- MainWP uses WP Cron for scheduling; ensure cron runs reliably
- Consider using Uptime Robot to ping your Dashboard for consistent cron execution
