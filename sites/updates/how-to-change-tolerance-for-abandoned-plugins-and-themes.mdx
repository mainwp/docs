## Recommended Values

| Days | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| 180 | Stricter monitoring, early warning of potential issues |
| 365 | Default balance between useful alerts and noise |
| 730 | Lenient monitoring, fewer alerts |
| 0 | Disable abandoned checking entirely |

---

## When to Adjust

### Use a shorter tolerance (180-270 days) if:

- You prioritize security and want early warning
- You manage high-profile or sensitive sites
- You prefer proactive plugin/theme replacement

### Use a longer tolerance (500+ days) if:

- You use stable plugins that update infrequently
- You receive too many false positives
- Your plugins are intentionally feature-complete without frequent updates

### Disable checking (0 days) if:

- You manually track plugin/theme status
- You use mostly premium plugins not on wordpress.org
- The alerts are not useful for your workflow
