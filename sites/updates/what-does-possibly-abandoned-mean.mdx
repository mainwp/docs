title: What does "Possibly Abandoned" mean?
description: >-
  MainWP checks the last updated status of plugins and themes and alerts you
  if they haven't been updated within a threshold (default 365 days). This helps
  identify potentially abandoned plugins or themes.
---

MainWP marks plugins and themes as "Possibly Abandoned" when the author has not released an update for a specified period. By default, this threshold is 365 days. Items without an official release for this duration appear in the Abandoned Plugins and Abandoned Themes sections of your Dashboard.

## Why This Matters

Abandoned plugins and themes can create problems for your sites:

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Security vulnerabilities | No patches for discovered security issues |
| Compatibility issues | May break with newer WordPress or PHP versions |
| Missing features | No improvements or bug fixes |
| Support unavailable | Developer may no longer provide assistance |

## How MainWP Detects Abandonment

MainWP checks the last-updated date on wordpress.org for each plugin and theme. If no update has been released within your configured threshold, the item is flagged as possibly abandoned.

<Note>
MainWP can only check items listed on wordpress.org. Premium plugins and themes or those delisted from wordpress.org cannot be detected as abandoned.
</Note>

## Where to View Abandoned Items

Find abandoned items at:

- **MainWP > Updates > Abandoned Plugins**
- **MainWP > Updates > Abandoned Themes**

## What to Do with Abandoned Items

1. **Assess the risk** - Consider if the plugin is critical and if alternatives exist
2. **Check GitHub** - Some plugins have active development on GitHub even without wordpress.org updates
3. **Find alternatives** - Search for actively maintained replacements
4. **Plan migration** - Replace abandoned items before they cause issues

## Adjust the Threshold

To change the number of days or disable this check, see [How to change tolerance for Abandoned Plugins and Themes](/sites/updates/how-to-change-tolerance-for-abandoned-plugins-and-themes).
