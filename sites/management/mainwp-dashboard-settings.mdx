    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Uptime Monitoring" icon="heart-pulse">
    For detailed information about uptime monitoring, see [Uptime Monitoring](/sites/management/manage-child-sites#uptime-monitoring).

    ### Enable Uptime Monitoring

    Toggle monitoring for all connected sites.

    ### Monitor Type

    - **HTTP(s)/Website Monitoring**: Sends HTTP(s) requests to verify site response
    - **Ping Monitoring**: Uses ICMP to ping the server
    - **Keyword Monitoring**: Checks for specific keywords on the page (reveals keyword field when selected)

    ### HTTP(s)/Website Monitoring Options

    | Setting | Description |
    |---------|-------------|
    | HTTP Method | GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE |
    | Monitor Interval | Check frequency from every 5 minutes to once daily |
    | Request Timeout | Maximum seconds before timeout |
    | Down Confirmation Check | Verify downtime before sending alerts |

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Site Health Monitoring" icon="stethoscope">
    ### Enable Site Health Monitoring

    Enables monitoring using WordPress core Site Health feature. Does not integrate with third-party services.

    ### Site Health Threshold

    Set how often MainWP checks child site health status.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Backup Options" icon="cloud-arrow-up">
    ### Enable Legacy Backups Feature

    MainWP recommends using backup extensions rather than the legacy system. For new installations, this feature is disabled by default.

    ### Select Primary Backup System
    **Default: N/A**

    When multiple backup extensions are installed, select which one serves as primary. View [available backup extensions](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-extensions/extension-category/backups/).

    ### Hide MainWP Child Plugin from Search Engines

    <Note>
    Removed in MainWP 4. The Child plugin now includes a custom .htaccess file with rewrite rules by default.
    </Note>

    The rewrite rule returns a 404 page when anyone tries to access `/wp-content/plugins/mainwp-child/`. This does not work on NGINX servers and does not hide the plugin from the WordPress admin area. To hide the plugin in wp-admin, use the [White Label Extension](/add-ons/agency/white-label-extension).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Advanced Settings" icon="sliders">
    Configure request settings to prevent sync issues, failed updates, and failed installations caused by too many simultaneous requests.

    ### Request Limits

    | Setting | Default | Description |
    |---------|---------|-------------|
    | Max simultaneous requests | 4 | Total concurrent requests to all child sites |
    | Min delay between requests | 200ms | Pause between consecutive requests |
    | Max simultaneous requests per IP | 1 | Concurrent requests to sites on the same server |
    | Min delay between requests to same IP | 1000ms | Pause between requests to the same server |
    | Max simultaneous sync requests | 8 | Sites synced concurrently |
    | Max simultaneous install/update requests | 3 | Concurrent update or install operations |
    | Max uptime monitoring requests | 10 | Concurrent uptime check requests |

    <Note>
    If child sites appear offline during sync operations, reduce the maximum simultaneous requests value.
    </Note>

    ### Optimize for Shared Hosting or Big Networks
    **Default: No**

    When enabled, MainWP caches updates for faster loading. Requires manual sync before performing updates. Recommended for Dashboards with 50+ sites or those on shared hosting.

    ### Use WP Cron
    **Default: Yes**

    Setting to No disables WP-Cron, stopping all scheduled events. Disabling requires [manual cron job configuration](https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/ALD/Cron+Jobs).

    ### Verify SSL Certificate
    **Default: Yes**

    When enabled, MainWP verifies SSL certificates when connecting to child sites. Disable if experiencing connection issues with self-signed or outdated certificates. This global setting can be overridden per site.

    ### Verify Connection Method
    **Default: OpenSSL**

    OpenSSL is recommended for most configurations. [PHPSecLib](/advanced/custom-signature-algorithm-and-phpseclib-as-alternative-to-openssl) serves as an alternative when OpenSSL is unavailable or misconfigured, particularly useful for localhost setups.

    ### OpenSSL Signature Algorithm
    **Default: OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256**

    SHA256 is the default, providing compatibility with both OpenSSL 1 and OpenSSL 3. Hosts running OpenSSL 3 may have disabled SHA1. See [custom signature algorithm documentation](/advanced/custom-signature-algorithm-and-phpseclib-as-alternative-to-openssl) for details.

    ### Force IPv4
    **Default: No**

    When enabled, forces IPv4 connections to child sites. Use on servers where IPv6 is not supported.
