MainWP identifies plugins and themes that may be abandoned based on how long since their last update. Abandoned items can pose security risks and compatibility issues since they no longer receive patches or improvements.

## What You'll Accomplish

- Understand what "abandoned" means in MainWP
- Manually check for abandoned plugins across your sites
- Manually check for abandoned themes across your sites
- Review abandoned items and decide on replacements

## Prerequisites

- MainWP Dashboard installed and activated
- At least one child site connected to your Dashboard
- Sites synced recently to have current plugin/theme data

---

## What Does "Abandoned" Mean?

MainWP marks a plugin or theme as "possibly abandoned" when its author has not released an update for the period set in your Dashboard settings. The default threshold is 365 days.

<Note>
MainWP fetches last-updated information from wordpress.org. Plugins or themes that are delisted from wordpress.org cannot be detected as abandoned.
</Note>

### Why Abandoned Items Matter

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Security vulnerabilities | No patches for discovered security issues |
| Compatibility issues | May break with newer WordPress or PHP versions |
| Missing features | No improvements or bug fixes |
| Support unavailable | Developer may no longer provide assistance |

---

## Automatic Checks

MainWP automatically checks for abandoned plugins and themes once per day during the scheduled sync process.

## What to Do with Abandoned Items

When you identify abandoned plugins or themes:

1. **Search for alternatives** - Look for actively maintained plugins with similar functionality
2. **Check last commit date** - Some plugins on wordpress.org may have active GitHub development
3. **Test replacements** - Install alternatives on a staging site first
4. **Plan migration** - Replace abandoned items before they cause issues
