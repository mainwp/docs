  excluding specific keywords from results. Useful for bulk actions when you
  need to exclude certain items like all WooCommerce-related plugins.

## How Negative Search Works

When you enable the **Negative Search** toggle in the search options:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Normal search | Shows items matching your keyword |
| Negative search | Shows items that do not match your keyword |

The feature filters the visible list, making it easy to select and act on the filtered results.

## Where to Find Negative Search

Negative Search is available in two locations:

| Page | Navigation |
|------|------------|
| Plugins | **MainWP > Plugins > Manage Plugins** |
| Themes | **MainWP > Themes > Manage Themes** |

Look for the **Search Options** dropdown, then toggle **Negative Search** before entering your search term.
