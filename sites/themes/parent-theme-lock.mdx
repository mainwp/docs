## How Parent Theme Lock Works

When a child theme is active on a site, it depends on its parent theme for core functionality and styling. Deleting the parent theme would break the site's appearance and potentially cause PHP errors.

Parent Theme Lock prevents this by blocking deletion of any parent theme that has an active child theme depending on it. The lock appears automatically—no configuration required.

## Where the Lock Appears

### Manage Themes Page

On **MainWP > Themes > Manage Themes**, locked parent themes show a lock icon. Hover over the icon to see why the theme cannot be deleted.

### Individual Site Overview

When viewing a specific child site's Overview page, the Themes widget shows the lock status for parent themes.

## Delete a Locked Parent Theme

If you need to delete a parent theme that's currently locked:

<Steps>
<Step title="Access child site admin">
Navigate to the child site's wp-admin using Jump to WP Admin or by logging in directly.
</Step>
<Step title="Open Themes">
Go to **Appearance > Themes**.
</Step>
<Step title="Switch themes">
Activate a different theme that does not depend on the parent you want to delete.
</Step>
<Step title="Sync the site">
Return to your MainWP Dashboard and sync the child site to update theme status.
</Step>
<Step title="Delete parent theme">
The parent theme is now unlocked and can be deleted from Manage Themes.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If multiple child sites use child themes that depend on the same parent, you must switch themes on all of them before the parent becomes deletable.
</Note>

## Why This Protection Matters

Without Parent Theme Lock, accidentally deleting a parent theme while cleaning up unused themes across your network could result in:

- Broken site appearance
- Missing templates
- Unstyled content
- PHP errors

The lock ensures you make a conscious decision to switch themes on affected sites before removing the parent from your network.
