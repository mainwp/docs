## API Backups

API Backups lets you create backups directly through your hosting provider, cloud manager, or VPS without installing backup plugins on your sites.

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| cPanel | Native and WP Toolkit backups |
| Plesk | WP Toolkit backups |
| Kinsta | Full API integration |
| Cloudways | Automatic site assignment |
| GridPane | Requires Owner Account with Developer Plan or higher |
| Vultr | Full API integration |
| Akamai (Linode) | Full API integration |
| DigitalOcean | Full API integration |

### Connect API Backups

Each provider requires an API key from their platform. Obtain your API key and enter it in the MainWP settings.

![Animation showing API Backups settings with API key entry fields for cloud providers](/images/dashboard/sites-backups-273419.gif)

### Assign Provider to Child Sites

Cloudways and GridPane automatically detect sites. For all other providers, assign the VPS provider to each child site manually.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open site settings">
Go to the Child Site **Overview > Edit** page.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure backup provider">
Locate the **Backup API Provider Settings** section, select your VPS provider from the dropdown, and enter the Instance ID.

![Child Site Edit page showing Backup API Provider Settings](/images/dashboard/sites-backups-b24544.png)
</Step>
<Step title="Save settings">
Click **Save Settings**.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Per-Site Configuration

For all providers except Cloudways and GridPane, you can enter hosting information per site. This allows you to use multiple accounts from the same provider across your child sites.

---

## cPanel Backups

New cPanel installations have backups disabled by default. Contact your hosting support to enable backups, or follow these steps if you have WHM access.

### Check Backup Status

The system displays a red notification on the File and Directory Restoration interfaces when backups are unavailable:
- cPanel: **Home > Files > File and Directory Restoration**
- WHM: **Home > Backups > File and Directory Restoration**

### Enable Backups via Terminal

If the red notification appears, run these commands to enable backups:

| Step | Command | Documentation |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Force initial backup | `backup --force` | [cPanel backup timing](https://support.cpanel.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050631974-How-can-I-change-the-backup-time) |
| Generate metadata | `backups_create_metadata` | [Metadata script](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/scripts/the-backups_create_metadata-script/) |

<Note>
cPanel automatic backups run on a cron schedule. You may need to manually trigger the first backup via terminal if no automatic backups exist yet. See [metadata management](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/backup/how-to-manage-metadata-settings/) for details.
</Note>

### Multi-Site Environment Configuration

For cPanel accounts with multiple WordPress sites, install each site in its own folder. Site paths are case sensitive.

**Multi-site example:**

| URL | Site Path |
|-----|-----------|
| `https://your-site.com/Child-1/` | `/public_html/Child-1/` |
| `https://child-2.your-site.com/` | `/public_html/child-2/` |

**Single-site example:**

| URL | Site Path |
|-----|-----------|
| `https://your-site.com` | `/public_html/` |

## Backup Storage Location

MainWP API Backups triggers backups through provider APIs. Your hosting provider handles storage according to their configured settings.

<Warning>
MainWP API Backups does not use custom storage locations. Backups are stored wherever your host or cloud manager has configured.
</Warning>

| Provider | Documentation |
|----------|---------------|
| GridPane | [Backup configuration](https://gridpane.com/kb/v2-backups-configuration-purging-exports/#location) |
| Cloudways | [Download backups](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5123346-how-to-download-the-backup-of-your-application) |
| Vultr | [Automatic backups](https://www.vultr.com/docs/vps-automatic-backups/) |
| DigitalOcean | [Backups product](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/images/backups/) |
| Akamai (Linode) | [Backup service](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/storage/backups/) |
| cPanel | [System backups](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/backup/system-backups/) |
| Plesk | [WP Toolkit backups](https://www.plesk.com/kb/docs/wp-toolkit-backing-up-and-restoring-wordpress-installations/) |

<Note>
**cPanel DB Backups:** Manual database backups are created via MySQLdump on the child site server and placed in `/wp-content/uploads/mainwp/api_db_backups/`.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Kinsta 404 Errors

If Kinsta API Backups fail to load or show a 404 error, the problem is usually an incorrect Environment ID or a temporary API issue.

**Example error from Custom Event Monitor:**
```text
API Backups :: [Status] 404 :: [Action] kinsta_action_refresh_available_backups
API Backups :: [Response] {"status":404,"message":"The requested environment was not found!"}
```

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Environment ID">
The Environment ID appears in the URL of the container package, not elsewhere in the interface.
</Step>
<Step title="Check all credentials">
Confirm your Account Email, Company ID, and API Key are entered correctly.
</Step>
<Step title="Save and refresh">
Save settings and click **Refresh Available Backups**.
</Step>
</Steps>

If the error persists with correct data, try again later as it may be a temporary Kinsta API issue.

### Plesk ID Confusion

Plesk API Backups may fail if you use the wrong ID during setup. Each WordPress installation in Plesk WP Toolkit has three IDs:

| ID Type | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Site ID | Main identifier for the WordPress installation |
| Domain ID | Appears in Plesk URL (not correct for backups) |
| Owner ID | Account owner identifier |

**Solution:** Use the **Main Site ID** instead of the Domain ID when configuring your Plesk connection in MainWP. Re-save settings and retry the backup.
