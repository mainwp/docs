title: Why Doesn't MainWP Include Backups in the Dashboard?
description: >-
  MainWP focuses on site management features rather than building native
  backups. We offer backup extensions that connect with top-tier providers and
  free API-based backups for popular hosting platforms.

MainWP focuses on site management rather than building a native backup system. Dedicated backup tools already solve this problem well, and creating our own would divert resources from features that make MainWP more valuable for managing your sites.

## Why Not Native Backups?

Backups for a self-hosted Dashboard managing multiple child sites come with complex requirements:

- Storage management across multiple sites
- Different hosting environments and configurations
- Scheduling and retention policies
- Restoration procedures that vary by host
- Ongoing maintenance and troubleshooting

Building and maintaining a native backup solution would slow development of core management features.

## How MainWP Handles Backups Instead

MainWP provides two approaches to backups:

### Backup Extensions

Extensions connect MainWP with established backup providers:

| Extension | Provider |
|-----------|----------|
| [BackWPup](https://mainwp.com/add-on/backwpup/) | BackWPup |
| [BackupBuddy](https://mainwp.com/add-on/mainwpbuddy/) | BackupBuddy |
| [Time Capsule](https://mainwp.com/add-on/time-capsule/) | Time Capsule |
| [UpdraftPlus](https://mainwp.com/add-on/updraftplus/) | UpdraftPlus |
| [WPVivid](https://mainwp.com/add-on/wpvivid-backup-for-mainwp/) | WPVivid |

### API Backups (Free)

[API Backups](/sites/backups/manage-backups#api-backups) trigger backups directly through your hosting provider at no additional cost:

- cPanel and Plesk
- Kinsta, Cloudways, GridPane
- Vultr, DigitalOcean, Linode

This approach lets you use backup services built specifically for that task while MainWP focuses on site management.
