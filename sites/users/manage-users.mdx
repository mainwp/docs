## Important Limitations

### Cannot Delete Connection User

MainWP prevents deleting the administrator account used to establish the connection with a child site. To delete this user:

1. Go to **MainWP > Sites > Manage Sites**
2. Edit the child site settings
3. Change the connected administrator to a different user
4. Delete the original user

### Content Attribution

When you delete a user who authored posts or pages, their content is automatically attributed to the connection administrator. To change authorship to a different user, bulk-edit the content directly in the child site's WP Admin.
