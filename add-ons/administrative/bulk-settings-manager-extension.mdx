With the [MainWP Bulk Settings Manager](https://mainwp.com/extension/bulk-settings-manager/) Extension, you can adjust your Child site settings for the WordPress Core and almost any WordPress Plugin or Theme.

## How it Works

MainWP Bulk Settings Manager Extension works together with the [MainWP Key Maker plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp-key-maker/). The Key Maker plugin grabs necessary data from your WordPress site (where you have set your preferences); next, the Extension converts the data to a key that you can submit to the rest of your child sites and apply your preferences. Quick and easy, with just a few clicks, you can update settings on all your child sites!

## Does Bulk Settings Manager work with the XYZ plugin or theme?

While we have not tested every plugin or theme, Bulk Settings Manager should technically work with any plugin or theme that uses standard forms. If you want to check if the information you want to work with will be recorded:

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the free MainWP Key Maker Plugin (link to WordPress.org)">
</Step>
<Step title="Submit the form you want to be able to use in Bulk Settings Manager.">
</Step>
<Step title="Once you have submitted the form, press the MainWP Key Maker button in your WP Admin Top Menu.">
Once you have submitted the form, press the MainWP Key Maker button in your WP Admin Top Menu.
</Step>
<Step title="Select the Post-submission Request key">
You will now see at least 2 "Keys" that will pop up for you: "Post-submission Request" and "Pre-submission Request". You almost always want to use Post-submission since that is the information gathered after you submitted the form.
</Step>
<Step title="Now click on “Verify Form Fields and Values” this will show you in a human-readable way what information was gathered.">
Now click on “Verify Form Fields and Values” this will show you in a human-readable way what information was gathered.
</Step>
</Steps>


If everything looks right and all your information was gathered correctly, you can be 99% sure that it will work with Bulk Settings Manager to change all your Child sites.
An example of where Bulk Settings Manager **would not work** is during the initial setup of JetPack, where you are required to leave your Child site to verify log-in credentials.
However, you would be able to set up keys for JetPack after the verify credential step.

Pre-submission requests often don't have all fields and values detected.
Using the Pre-submission requests may lead to incomplete Keys.
We strongly recommend using Post-submission requests!

To see the Post-submission request, you need to submit the form that you are trying to grab and make the Key.
Once you get to the page where the form is located, make sure that the wanted values are correctly set, submit the form, and after that, you will see the Post-submission request.
Some forms are divided into multiple mini-forms.
MainWP Key Maker plugin detects all mini-forms and displays Post-submission requests for all of them.
If you get multiple Post-Submission requests, be sure to use the Verify Form Fields and Values button and find the "biggest" one.
The request that is showing all form fields will probably be the one.

## Add a Key to a Key Ring

Key Ring feature allows you to group your Keys and submit them all at once. It comes pretty handy in case one Plugin or Theme has multiple settings forms. After you create all Keys for a plugin or theme, you can group them in a single Key Rings that allow you to manage them more efficiently.

## Create a Single Key

MainWP Bulk Settings Manager extension allows you to create Keys manually or import them from the MainWP Key Maker plugin or a file. Please note that we highly recommend making your keys by importing them from the Key Maker plugin. This method is much easier, quicker, and minimizes potential issues. However, if you decide to make keys manually, note that it is a harder process and recommended only to advanced users.

### Make a Single Key with the Key Maker plugin.

The Bulk Settings Manager Extension works with the MainWP Key Maker plugin to record your form settings and make a “key.” Once you have the “key,” you save it into your Bulk Settings Manager Extension. From this point, you can submit your settings to child sites, or if needed, you can update your settings and submit them to child sites after that.

<Steps>
<Step title="Login into your website where you have the plugin set as you want it">

## Bulk Settings Manager Settings

-   **Delay** – allows you to set a time delay between two submissions. For example, if you set a delay to 5 seconds and submit a key to 3 child sites after the Key has been submitted to the first site, the extension will wait for 5 seconds before it proceeds to the next child site. **This option helps you to reduce server load.**
-   **Clear History** – by clicking the button, you will delete all historical data from the Bulk Settings Manager extension.
-   **Use Boilerplate** – if enabled, you will be able to use Boilerplate tokens as key field values. **Note that this option works only if the [MainWP Boilerplate Extension](https://mainwp.com/extension/boilerplate/) has been installed and activated on your MainWP Dashboard.**

## How to Use Boilerplate Tokens in Keys

MainWP Bulk Settings Manager Extension supports Boilerplate tokens. By using tokens, it is possible to set per-site unique values in forms. Changing the WP > Settings > General Settings form is the best example of this. In the WP General Settings, 2 fields have to have unique values for each child site. Those are **Site URL** (siteurl) and **WordPress Address** (home). So to properly handle this form,

<Steps>
<Step title="Make sure that the Support for Boilerplate tokens is enabled">
Make sure that the Support for Boilerplate tokens is enabled![Use boilerplate option](/images/add-ons/bulk-settings-boilerplate-option.jpg)
</Step>
<Step title="Next, after creating the Key, please find it in the list and Edit it">
</Step>
<Step title="Locate the siteurl and home key fields">
</Step>
<Step title="Replace the URL in key with the [url.site] token.">
Replace the URL in key with the [url.site] token.![Key fields](/images/add-ons/bulk-settings-key-fields-tokens.png)
</Step>
<Step title="Save settings.">
</Step>
</Steps>


By default, the [url.site] token values are set for each child site. But if you need to use any other token or even create a custom one, be sure that values are set for each child you submit the key to.

## Change WordPress Administration Email Address on Multiple Child Sites at Once

  allowFullScreen
></iframe> The WordPress admin email address of all/selected Child sites can be changed using the Bulk Settings Manager extension. Considering that the Bulk Settings Manager will overwrite all WordPress General Settings and that the **WordPress Address (URL)** and **Site Address (URL)** must be unique for each Child site, we will use the Boilerplate extension to define tokens for those two fields. Both extensions are included in our [Pro plan](https://mainwp.com/signup/). Please note that the tutorial is written with the assumption that the Administration Email Address is the only field that needs to be changed and that all other options on the WordPress General Settings page should be the same on all Child sites. Follow the following steps, and visit linked articles for detailed instructions for individual steps.

## How to fix Invalid nonce error in Bulk Settings Manager

When saving a key to a Child Sites, Bulk Setting Manager can, under some circumstances, report an "Invalid nonce" error message. ![Invalid nonce error](/images/add-ons/bulk-settings-sync-nonce-error.png) To resolve this issue:

<Steps>
<Step title="Edit the key">
</Step>
<Step title="Create a new text field by drag-and-dropping the 'Text Field' from the 'Available Fields' box on the right">
Create a new text field by drag-and-dropping the "Text Field" from the "Available Fields" box on the right ![Add new key field](/images/add-ons/bulk-settings-add-text-field.gif)
</Step>
<Step title="Fill in the values of the Text Field">
Fill in the values of the Text Field
    1.  Description: can be any arbitrary value
    2.  Name: use the text from the error message after the "Try to use:" part
    3.  Value: mainwp-bsm-unverify-nonce ![New key field values](/images/add-ons/bulk-settings-text-field-nonce.png)
</Step>
<Step title="Save the key">
</Step>
</Steps>


If another type of Nonce error message appears after saving the key, repeat the steps above by adding another Text Field in the key, but in the Name field, use the new error name.

## How to change Rank Math settings on your child sites using Bulk Settings Manager

In this help document, we will cover how to change the settings of the Rank Math plugin on your Child Sites using Bulk Settings Manager. Even though most settings pages can be changed, a notable exception is toggling Modules On/Off on the **Rank Math > Dashboard** page because that page doesn't use submission requests to save changes. ![RankMath plugin page](/images/add-ons/bulk-settings-rankmath-dashboard.png) **Note:** Considering that the Bulk Settings Manager will overwrite all options on a given settings page, please ensure that it is acceptable that all Child sites have the same options on that page. This help document will cover how to change the options on the **Rank Math > General Settings** page. However, the same logic applies to other settings pages. To change Rank Math settings, please follow the following steps, and visit linked articles for detailed instructions for individual steps.
