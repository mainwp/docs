[MainWP Maintenance Extension](https://mainwp.com/add-on/maintenance/) allows you to clean your child site's databases. With just a few clicks, you can easily delete all post revisions, auto drafts, trash posts, spam comments and remove non-essential content from multiple databases at once.

That’s not all; our intuitive scheduling system will enable you to schedule multiple tasks and have your sites cleaned regularly. The MainWP Plugin will automatically perform maintenance as per your instructions.

Another great feature that this extension provides is Database optimization; with just a click of a button, you can quickly optimize all your child site databases to reduce storage space and increase I/O efficiency.

The “OPTIMIZE TABLE” command reorganizes the physical storage of table data and associated index data. This helps to reduce storage space and improve I/O efficiency when accessing your WordPress database—the exact changes made to each table depending on the storage engine used by that table.

Before doing any maintenance jobs, we highly recommend creating your child sites databases backup.
