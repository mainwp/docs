## Manually clear cache

The cache will be cleared automatically upon WP Core, Theme, or a Plugin update, but you can also manually trigger the clear.

### From the Manage Sites table

Cache can be cleared for any number of sites from the Manage Sites page. Select a number of desired sites, or all of them, and then from the Bulk Actions menu, select Clear Cache Control, and then click **Apply**. ![Animated screenshot showing bulk Clear Cache Control action being applied to multiple sites](/images/add-ons/cache-control-purge-action.gif)

### Using widgets

Cache Control widgets are located on the [Overview](/getting-started/mainwp-user-interface) page and the [Individual Child Sites Overview](/getting-started/mainwp-user-interface) pages. Locate them and simply click the Clear Cache button. If you do not see the widget, you may need to enable it from the [Page Settings](/getting-started/mainwp-user-interface). ![Screenshot of Cache Control widget with Clear Cache button](/images/add-ons/cache-control-purge-success.png)

## Cloudflare cache purging

For the Cloudflare cache purging to work, you must enter a valid Cloudflare API Email and Cloudflare API Key and enable "Use Cloudflare Cache API" setting. ![Screenshot of Cloudflare API settings with Email and API Key fields](/images/add-ons/cache-control-cloudflare-settings.png) **NOTE** Since version 4.0.1, the Cache Control extension will handle cache purging of both Cloudflare and the supported caching plugin at the same time. Previously, if both caching solutions were present, only the caching plugin was supported.
