This includes giving you the ability to manage your preferences, clear or preload cache on your child sites. This powerful combination will enable you to:

-   Cache Pages
-   Preload Cache
-   Enable Browser Caching
-   Optimize Google Fonts
-   Use LazyLoad
-   Minify JS, HTML and CSS files
-   Optimize Images
-   Defer JavaScript Loading
-   Use CDN

and much more…

## What makes WP Rocket better than the other caching plugins?

WP Rocket integrates all the latest features in terms of performance: deferred loading of images and JavaScript, minification of HTML code, concatenation, and minification of CSS and JavaScript files. While being complete, WP Rocket is also very simple to configure, even for beginners. WP Rocket also has its own self-hosted crawler bot that will visit your site and generate cached files so that when human visitors come to your website, they immediately get the fast, cached version of the page. If you have issues with the WP Rocket plugin, help documentation can be found here: http://docs.wp-rocket.me/.

From the **MainWP > Extensions > Rocket > Overview page****,** you can **hide/unhide** the WP Rocket plugin on your child sites, and quickly **access** the plugin settings on a child site or the WP Admin section. Actions are provided in the actions menu. If you know that you have the plugin installed on a child site, but the child site doesn't appear in the list, try to re-sync your sites.
