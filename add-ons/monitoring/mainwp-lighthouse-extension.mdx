## Widgets and Manage Sites table information

You can enable Performance Score columns (Desktop and Mobile) for the Manage Sites table from the Page Settings menu.

![Screenshot of Page Settings menu with Performance Score columns option](/images/add-ons/268cb5b38c9f.png)

Widgets are available on the main Overview page and on the Child Site's Overview page. 

They can also be enabled in the Page Settings on the relevant page.

The widget on the main Overview page provides scores for the best and worst performing sites:

![Animated screenshot of Lighthouse widget showing best and worst performing sites](/images/add-ons/lighthouse-widget-scores.gif)

And the widget on the Child Site's Overview page provides scores for Desktop and Mobile and how that score has changed since the preceding audit.

## Lighthouse Settings

![Screenshot of Lighthouse settings page showing all configuration options](/images/add-ons/lighthouse-widget.png)

-   **Google PageSpeed Insights API key** - In order to run audits, you need to enter your Google PageSpeed API key, if you don't have it, [see here how to get it](/add-ons/performance/mainwp-lighthouse-extension#get-the-google-pagespeed-insights-api-key).
-   **Language** - Select language for Lighthouse reports.
-   **Strategy** - Select if you want to get reports for Desktop, Mobile, or Both versions of sites.
-   **Notifications threshold** - Set the threshold for notifications. If the score goes under the set value, the add-on will notify you.
-   **Automatically audit sites** - If you want the add-on to automatically run audits, enable this feature.
-   **Automated audit frequency** - If automated audits are enabled, here you can set how often you want them to run.
-   **Maximum execution time** - Change the Max execution time if needed. If the Lighthouse reports are not being completed, increasing this value may help.
-   **Maximum script run time** - Change the Max script run time if needed. If your scans do not finish completely and changing the Maximum Execution Time does not help, increase this value until you find the maximum allowed runtime.
-   **Throttling delay time** - Change the Throttling delay time. Increasing this value may slow down Lighthouse reporting, but may help provide more accurate reports on poorly performing web servers.

## Audit Sites via WP CLI

Scan one or multiple sites:

wp mainwp-lighthouse audit 125,126

or all

wp mainwp-lighthouse audit --all
