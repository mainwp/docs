The MainWP Advanced Uptime Monitor extension allows you to monitor your websites' uptime by integrating with various uptime monitoring services through their APIs. This extension enables you to create, edit, display, or delete your monitors directly from the MainWP Dashboard.

The extension currently supports these uptime monitoring services:

-   Uptime Robot
-   Better Uptime
-   NodePing
-   Site24x7

The extension itself does not check for uptime, nor does it notify in case of some event. Both of these actions are performed by third-party uptime monitoring services.

</Step>
</Steps>


### Monitor Types

-   **http(s):** Perfect for website monitoring. The service regularly sends requests (which are the same as if a visitor is browsing your website) to the URL and decides if it is up or down depending on the HTTP statuses returned from the website (200-success, 404-not found, etc.)
-   **ping:** Good for monitoring a server. Ping (ICMP) requests are sent, and up/down status is decided according to whether responses are received. Ping is not a good fit for monitoring websites as a website (its IP) can respond to ping requests while it is down (which means that the site is down but the server hosting the site is up)
-   **keyword:** Checks if a keyword exists or does not exist on a web page
-   **port:** Good for monitoring services like SMTP, DNS, POP as all these services run from a specific port, and Uptime Robot decides their statuses based on whether they respond to the requests

### API limitations of the free Uptime Robot plan

Uptime Robot has recently reduced the limit to only **10 requests per minute**. Requests include creating new monitors through the MainWP extension and fetching information about existing monitors. Reaching the limit is fairly easy for a large number of sites.

This limit is most often hit when creating monitors for all sites by clicking the **"Create Monitors for All Sites"** button in the UI. You will likely be able to create 2 or 3 monitors **per attempt** and receive an error (red exclamation mark) for other sites because the API limit will be reached.

<Warning>
**Important Notes:**
- MainWP Advanced Uptime Monitor Extension does not support Monitor Specific API Keys.
- If you cannot create your first monitor from the MainWP Advanced Uptime Monitor Extension, try creating the first monitor directly in the Uptime Robot dashboard, then create subsequent monitors from your Extension.
- If you cannot connect your account, try re-creating your Uptime Robot API key and try again.
- If data is not loading properly from your Uptime Robot account, try resaving the Uptime Robot settings in the Advanced Uptime Monitor Extension.
</Warning>
