</Info>

![Matomo Extension dashboard showing analytics data](/images/add-ons/matomo-dashboard-overview.png) The [MainWP Matomo (formerly Piwik) Extension](/add-ons/analytics/matomo-extension) gives you valuable insights into your visitor's search and traffic patterns, your marketing campaigns, and much more, allowing you to optimize your strategy and the online experience of your users. Matomo is the leading open-source web analytics platform and can help you gather and analyze important information about your visitors. Track Key Performance Indicators such as visits, goal conversion rates, downloads, keywords, and much more. **Important Notes:** The Matomo Extension doesn't allow you to insert the Piwik tracking code on your child sites. To do that, you will need to add the code manually or use a 3rd party plugin. The Matomo Extension is compatible only with Matomo Dashboard, On-Premise or Cloud. **Matomo for WordPress plugin and Piwik Pro are not supported.** That means that the extension cannot ready data directly from the Matomo for WordPress plugin!

## Use this Extension To Track:

-   Visits
-   Pageviews
-   Pages/Visit
-   Bounce Rate
-   Average Time on Site
-   New Visits

The extension works with both Matomo Cloud and Matomo on Premise.

Both options require a few easy-to-follow steps. After installing and adding your blogs, it easily integrates with your MainWP Matomo (Piwik) Extension.

## Matomo (formerly Piwik) Analytics Widget

The Matomo Analytics widget allows you to track data in your MainWP Dashboard. The global widget will be added to the Overview page and individual widget on each child site overview page.

## How to enable Unique Visitors in the extension

![Matomo Unique Visitors configuration note](/images/add-ons/matomo-unique-visitors-note.png) MainWP Matomo extension fetches data via API about the last 7 or last 30 days from the Matomo Dashboard. Those date ranges are considered to be "custom date ranges" by Matomo. Out of the box, Matomo calculates Unique Visitors for the Period of Day, Week, and Month. It does not calculate it for the Year or custom ranges such as last 7 or 30 days. To enable this calculation, please follow the instructions in this Matomo help document: [https://matomo.org/faq/how-to/faq_113/](https://matomo.org/faq/how-to/faq_113/)
