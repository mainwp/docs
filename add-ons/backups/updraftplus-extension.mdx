#### Important Note

After installing the UpdraftPlus plugin, it is required to Synchronize your sites so your MainWP Dashboard becomes aware that the plugin has been installed and activated.

## UpdraftPlus Backups Dashboard

From the **MainWP > Extensions > UpdraftPlus > Overview page****,** you can monitor all of your child sites where you have the UpdraftPlus plugin installed. In the sites list, you will be notified if the plugin has an update available or if the plugin is deactivated.

-   In case the plugin is not activated, the **Activate** action will appear in the corresponding site row.
-   If there is a new version of the plugin, the **Update** action will appear in the corresponding site row.

### Available Actions

From the **MainWP > Extensions > UpdraftPlus > Overview page****,** you can **hide/unhide** the UpdraftPlus plugin on your child sites, quickly **access** the plugin settings on a child site or the WP Admin section. Actions are provided in the actions menu.

#### Important Notes

If you know that you have the plugin installed on a child site, but the child site doesn't appear in the list, try to re-sync your sites.

## UpdraftPlus Settings

MainWP UpdraftPlus Extension allows you to manage UpdraftPlus Plugin settings on your child sites. From the settings tab, you can set the following options for your child sites.

-   Files Backup Schedule
-   Database Backup Schedule
-   Include/Exclude Files from Backups
-   Database options
-   Notifications
-   Set Remote Storage options
    -   Note: Due to security reasons imposed by the providers of remote storage options, some of them may need to be authenticated on the child site itself. After that initial authentication, the rest of the setup can be performed via MainWP Dashboard.
-   Advanced Debugging Options

If you use the Premium version of the UpdraftPlus Plugin, make sure the Use Premium Version is set to YES. This will show you premium version options.

### UpdraftPlus Settings per Child Site

All UpdraftPlus Settings can be set separately for different child sites. To do this, go to the MainWP > Sites page, and in the sites table, under the child site URL, you can find the UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore link. This link will open Individual site UpdraftPlus Options. The Settings tab will show you all plugin options to set custom settings for the child site. To override global options, set the **Override General Settings** to **YES** and click the Save button.
