</Info>

![Screenshot of BackWPup add-on dashboard showing child sites with backup status](/images/add-ons/backwpup-dashboard-overview.png)

With the MainWP BackWPup Add-on, you can control the [BackWPup Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/backwpup/) settings for all your child sites directly from your MainWP Dashboard. This includes giving you the ability to create your child site backups and even set Backup schedules directly from your MainWP Dashboard.

## Installing the BackWPUp add-on

The MainWP BackWPup add-on needs to be installed **only on your MainWP Dashboard** site. You can [install it as any other MainWP add-on](https://mainwp.com/kb/manage-extensions/#install-add-ons).

## Installing the BackWPUp Plugin

For the proper use of the MainWP BackWPup Add-on, you need to install the BackWPup Plugin on your child sites. The plugin does not need to be installed on the MainWP Dashboard site.

</Step>
<Step title="Go to the MainWP > Sites > Plugins > Install Plugins page">

</Step>
</Steps>


**Important Notes:**  
After installing the BackWPup Plugin, it is required to Synchronize your sites, so your MainWP Dashboard becomes aware that the Plugin has been installed and activated.

## BackWPUp Dashboard

From the **MainWP > Add-ons > BackWPup > BacWPUp Dashboard page,** you can monitor all of your child sites where you have the BackWPup plugin installed. In the sites list, you will be notified if the plugin has an update available (the row will be highlighted in yellow) or if the plugin is deactivated (highlighted in red).

### Available Actions

![Screenshot of BackWPup ellipsis menu showing available actions](/images/add-ons/backwpup-actions-menu.png)

From ellipsis menu, you can access relevant actions such as Child Site's Overview and Edit pages, as well the ability to:

-   **Hide/Unhide** the BackWPUp plugin on the child site
-   **Open BackWPUp** plugin page on the Child Site
-   Run a backup job
-   **Update** the BackWPUp plugin on the Child site
-   **Activate** it if it is deactivated

### **Important Notes:**

If you know that you have the BackWPUp plugin installed on a child site, but the child site doesn't appear in the list, try to re-sync your sites.
