<Info>
**Integration Add-on** - This add-on extends MainWP to work with Solid Backups (formerly BackupBuddy). Requires Solid Backups to be installed on your child sites.
</Info>

With the MainWP Solid Backups Extension (formerly Buddy Extension), you can control the [Solid Backups plugin](https://solidwp.com/solid-backups/) (formerly BackupBuddy) on all your child sites directly from your MainWP Dashboard.

<Note>
This extension was previously known as "MainWP Buddy Extension" when it integrated with BackupBuddy. After iThemes was acquired by StellarWP, BackupBuddy was rebranded to Solid Backups. The functionality remains the same.
</Note>

This includes giving you the ability to create your child site backups and even set Backup schedules directly from your MainWP Dashboard. **Important Notes:** The MainWP Buddy Extension requires an active BackupBuddy subscription which can be purchased from StellarWP MainWP Buddy Extension does not support the auto restore feature for the BackupBuddy backups. Backups created by the BackupBuddy plugin can be restored only manually. If you need to restore your site from a BackupBuddy backup, please check the Solid Backups documentation. Backups created by the BackupBuddy plugin are not suitable for the MainWP Cloning and MainWP Auto Restore feature. MainWP Buddy Extension requires the BackupBuddy plugin installed and activated on your child sites.

Actions are provided in the actions menu. If you know that you have the plugin installed on a child site, but the child site doesn't appear in the list, try to re-sync your sites.
