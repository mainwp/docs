<Info>
**Integration Add-on** - This add-on extends MainWP to work with WP Time Capsule. Requires WP Time Capsule to be installed on your child sites.
</Info>

With the MainWP Time Capsule Extension, you can control the WP Time Capsule Plugin settings on all your child sites directly from your MainWP Dashboard. This includes giving you the ability to create your child site backups and even restore your child sites to a point back in time directly from your Dashboard.

All changes to your Child sites are backed up automatically as they happen. Any change on your website will trigger a backup in real-time. Since only the changes are backed up, the total space used for storing your backups is reduced to a minimum. The system allows you to store your backups in remote locations such as:

-   Dropbox
-   Amazon S3
-   Google Drive

**Important Notes:** For additional help with the WP Time Capsule plugin options, please consult the official [WP Time Capsule plugin documentation](https://docs.wptimecapsule.com/).
