**Key features:**
- Generate professional reports in seconds
- Pre-made templates to get you started
- Automatic PDF attachment to emails
- Include or exclude specific content
- Customizable template system

## Setting up the Pro Reports Extension

### Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Install MainWP Child Reports">
[Install](/sites/plugins/managing-plugins-with-mainwp) the [MainWP Child Reports](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp-child-reports/) plugin on all child sites. This free plugin records logging events that appear in your reports. Records are kept for 100 days.
</Step>
<Step title="Install Pro Reports Extension">
[Install](/dashboard/overview/manage-extensions#install-add-ons) the MainWP Pro Reports Extension on your Dashboard.
</Step>
<Step title="Sync your sites">
Sync your sites so the Dashboard can detect which sites have the Child Reports plugin installed.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Reports require recorded activity.** The MainWP Child Reports plugin must collect site data before reports can show meaningful content. After installation, allow several days for the plugin to record events such as updates, posts, and changes. Reports generated immediately after installation will display empty sections.
</Warning>

<Tip>
To test Pro Reports with default settings, skip to [Create a One-Time Report](#create-a-one-time-report). Client information and custom branding can be configured later.
</Tip>

## MainWP Child Reports Plugin

The [MainWP Child Reports plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp-child-reports/) records changes on your child sites and communicates them to the Pro Reports Extension. Built on the [Stream Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stream/), it requires PHP 7.0 or higher.

### Viewing Recorded Data

Go to **WP Admin > Settings > MainWP Child > MainWP Child Reports** on your child site to see recorded activity.

![Child reports data](/images/add-ons/pro-reports-activity-log.jpg)

### Child Reports Settings

![Child Reports settings](/images/add-ons/pro-reports-child-settings.png)

Navigate to **WP Admin > Settings > MainWP Child > MainWP Child Reports Settings** to configure the plugin.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Hide from reports | Excludes the MainWP Child Reports plugin from reports |
| Keep Records Indefinitely | Retains all records (not recommended for performance) |
| Keep Records for | Maximum days to retain activity records (default: 100) |
| Akismet Tracking | Track comment spam attempts blocked by Akismet (not recommended) |
| Comment Flood Tracking | Track duplicate comments blocked by WordPress (not recommended) |
| WP-Cron Tracking | Track cron event activity (not recommended) |
| Reset Database | Delete all activity reports from the database |

### Client Information

Pro Reports uses tokens to personalize reports without creating separate versions for each client. Tokens are placeholders like `[client.email]` and `[client.name]` that get replaced with actual values when reports generate. You can define client information in two ways:

| Method | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Client Feature | Define information once, assign multiple sites to a client | Managing many sites per client |
| Per-Site Settings | Set information individually on each site's Edit page | Maximum flexibility |

<Note>
When the same token is defined in both locations, the per-site value takes priority.
</Note>

#### Setting Per-Site Client Information

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to site settings">
Go to **MainWP Dashboard > Sites > Manage Sites** and click **Edit** on the desired site.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure tokens">
Locate the **Pro Reports Tokens** section and enter values for tokens you plan to use.
![Pro report tokens](/images/add-ons/pro-reports-tokens-form.jpg)

## Pro Reports Dashboard

![MainWP Child Reports Overview](/images/add-ons/pro-reports-child-dashboard.png)

The **MainWP > Extensions > Pro Reports > Child Reports Dashboard** page monitors all child sites with the MainWP Child Reports plugin installed.

### Status Indicators

| Row Color | Meaning | Available Action |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Red | Plugin not activated | Activate |
| Yellow | Update available | Update |
| Normal | Plugin active and current | Hide/Unhide |

### Dashboard Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Version | MainWP Child Reports plugin version |
| Last Report | When the last report was sent |
| Reports DB Size | Database space used by reports |

Bulk actions for Activate, Update, Hide, and Unhide are available at the top of the page. If a site with the plugin installed does not appear, re-sync your sites.

## Translate Titles and Headings

Pro Reports 4.1.1 introduced the **Custom Titles** feature for translating and customizing all titles, subtitles, and table headings. Find this option in the **Report Content & Design Customization** section.

![Report custom titles](/images/add-ons/pro-reports-custom-titles.gif)

Customized strings are saved per report, allowing multiple language versions. Actual data values depend on the language of plugins, themes, and WordPress Core on child sites and cannot be translated through this feature.

## Create Custom Report Templates

Pro Reports uses PHP templates that you can customize with HTML. The process involves copying a built-in template and modifying it to suit your needs.

### Creating a Custom Template

<Steps>
<Step title="Download the extension">
[Download the MainWP Pro Reports Extension](/dashboard/overview/manage-extensions) from your MainWP Account.
</Step>
<Step title="Extract and locate templates">
Extract the plugin files and find the default templates in `/mainwp-pro-reports-extension/templates/reports/`.
</Step>
<Step title="Copy and customize">
Copy a PHP file, rename it, and edit with your preferred code editor.
</Step>
<Step title="Upload the template">
Upload your customized PHP file to `/wp-content/uploads/mainwp/report-templates/` on your Dashboard site.
</Step>
<Step title="Select the template">
Your template appears in the **Report template** dropdown.
![Report template selection](/images/add-ons/pro-reports-template-dropdown.png)
</Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Template Resources" icon="book-open" defaultOpen>
    <CardGroup cols={3}>
      <Card title="Custom Templates Guide" icon="file-code" href="/add-ons/agency/create-custom-report-templates">
        Build custom PHP templates from scratch with detailed token placement.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Add Images to Templates" icon="image" href="/add-ons/agency/how-to-add-images-to-custom-pro-report-templates">
        Insert custom images and graphics into your report templates.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Limit Table Entries" icon="list-ol" href="/add-ons/agency/limit-the-amount-of-table-entries-in-the-pro-report-sections">
        Control how many rows appear in report sections using CSS.
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Token Types

Pro Reports uses four token types that you can add directly to PHP templates or through the visual editor.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Client Tokens | Display data from Individual Child site settings | `[client.email]`, `[client.name]` |
| Section Tokens | Loop through database records within a date range | `[section.plugins.installed]...[/section.plugins.installed]` |
| Data Tokens | Display specific values inside section tokens | `[plugin.name]`, `[plugin.installed.date]` |
| Counter Tokens | Display counts outside section tokens | `[plugin.installed.count]` |

See all available tokens: [Available Pro Reports Tokens](/add-ons/agency/available-pro-reports-tokens)

### Client Tokens

Client tokens display data set in the Individual Child site Edit tab. Set values for tokens you plan to use in reports.

![Site token values](/images/add-ons/pro-reports-site-tokens.png)

Use `[client.email]` in the **Send email to** field to send reports to multiple clients automatically.

![Email settings](/images/add-ons/pro-reports-email-settings.png)

Click **Insert tokens** to see available options.

![Field tokens](/images/add-ons/pro-reports-available-tokens.png)

### How Tokens Work Together

The following example demonstrates all three token types working together in a template:

```
Plugins installed: [plugin.installed.count]

[section.plugins.installed]
  Plugin: [plugin.name]
  Installed: [plugin.installed.date]
[/section.plugins.installed]
```

**Counter tokens** display totals and must appear outside section tags. They end with `.count`.

**Section tokens** loop through database records within the report date range. They require opening and closing tags.

**Data tokens** display specific values and must appear between section token tags.
