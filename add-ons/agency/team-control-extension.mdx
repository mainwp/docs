[MainWP Team Control Add-on](https://mainwp.com/add-on/team-control/) allows you to create custom roles for your dashboard site users. With the custom roles you create, you can limit access to certain MainWP Dashboard features and actions. Also, it allows you to limit access only to certain child sites. To create your MainWP Management team, you need to:

<Steps>
<Step title="Create your custom role(s)">
</Step>
<Step title="Define Permissions and select allowed child sites for the role(s)">
</Step>
<Step title="Create new users (optional)">
</Step>
<Step title="Assign the role to dashboard site users">
</Step>
</Steps>


Users without permission won’t be able to use unselected actions nor to access certain MainWP Dashboard pages. Team Control extension allows you to create custom roles only on your MainWP Dashboard site. Roles created with the MainWP Team Control extension have effect only inside the MainWP Dashboard plugin. If you need to limit access to certain WP Admins sections, you will need to use a 3rd party plugin. Any role created by the extension is equivalent to the Administrator role outside of the MainWP Dashboard plugin.

## Create a Custom Role

To create a custom role,

<Steps>
<Step title="Login in to your MainWP Dashboard">
</Step>
<Step title="Go to the MainWP > Extensions > Team Control page">
</Step>
<Step title="Go to the Roles and Permissions tab">
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Create Custom Role button">
Click the **Create Custom Role** button![Create Custom Role button](/images/add-ons/team-control-create-role-button.jpg)
</Step>
<Step title="Enter a Role Name">
</Step>
<Step title="Enter a Role Description">
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Create Role button">
Click the **Create Role** button![Create role button](/images/add-ons/team-control-create-role-form.jpg)
</Step>
</Steps>


Once this is done, proceed with assigning wanted permissions for the role.

## Define Role Permissions

<Step title="Login in to your MainWP Dashboard">
</Step>
<Step title="Go to the MainWP > Extensions > Team Control page">

</Step>
<Step title="Click the Save action">
</Step>
</Steps>


After setting custom permissions, you are ready to assign this role to an existing user or to [create a new user](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/users-add-new-screen/) with this role. If you'd like for a certain user to automatically have access to a newly added Child Site, grant the user access to a Site Tag. Then when adding the Child Site, add that site to the respective Site Tag. By selecting permission, extension, or website, you are allowing users with this role to use this action, extension on the allowed sites. If you allow sites by selecting a tag of child sites after adding a new site to the tag, it is required to re-save role settings to allow the newly added site to the role.
