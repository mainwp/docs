This article clarifies how custom tokens function in MainWP at both the site level and the client level.

## Site-Level Tokens:

-   **Priority Over Client-Level:** Tokens defined per site (on the Edit page of a Child Dashboard) take precedence over client-level tokens.
-   **Direct Control:** If a token is edited at the site level, it overrides any same-named token set at the client level.
-   **Usage:** Site-level tokens are ideal for specific, unique information relevant to an individual site.

## Client-Level Tokens:

-   **Fallback Mechanism:** If a token is not set or left empty at the site level, the client-level token is used instead.
-   **General Information:** Client-level tokens are suitable for information that applies uniformly across multiple sites owned by a client.
-   **Distinct from Site Tokens:** Despite sometimes sharing names, client-level tokens are different and separate from site-level tokens.

## Managing Redundant Tokens

-   **No Need for Deletion:** It is not necessary to delete tokens even if they share names between client and site levels.
-   **Selective Input:** Enter values where most appropriate (client or site level) and leave the other level empty if not needed.
-   **Pro Reports Prioritization:** In the context of Pro Reports, if both levels have a token with the same name, the site-level token is prioritized.

## Meta-Data Storage Without Reports

-   **Custom Fields for Meta-Data:** Users can create custom fields on the Child Site Edit screen to store personal information or meta-data unrelated to Pro Reports.
-   **Independence from Plugins:** This method allows for the addition of meta-data that is not dependent on plugins, ensuring data retention even without Pro Reports.
