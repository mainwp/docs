</Info>

[MainWP Post Dripper Extension](https://mainwp.com/extension/post-dripper/) allows you to deliver posts or pages to your child sites over a pre-scheduled period of time. The Extension allows you to drip:

-   Posts
-   Pages
-   Boilerplate Posts **(only if the [Boilerplate Extension](https://mainwp.com/extension/boilerplate/) is installed and activated)**
-   Boilerplate Pages  **(only if the [Boilerplate Extension](https://mainwp.com/extension/boilerplate/) is installed and activated)**

## How it Works

Post Dripper Extension allows you to set how fast you want to publish content on the selected number of sites during 1 session. The Extension will post to all selected child sites. Once the Post/Page is published on all selected sites, the drip session ends. It will never publish the same content to one child site multiple times.

### Example 1

Publish this post to 1 site every 1 day (20 child sites selected)

-   Day 1: the article gets published on the first child site
-   Day 2: the article gets published on the second child site
-   Day 3: the article gets published on the third child site
-   ...
-   Day 20: the article gets published on the 20th child site

### Example 2

Publish this post to 3 sites every 2 days (20 child sites selected)

-   Day 1: the article gets published on the first 3 child sites
-   Day 2: nothing gets published
-   Day 3: the article gets published on the second 3 child sites
-   Day 4: nothing gets published
-   Day 5: the article gets published on the third 3 child sites
-   Day 6: nothing gets published
-   ...
-   Day 13: the article gets published on the last 2 child sites

### Example 3

Publish this post to 5 sites every 1 week (20 child sites selected)

-   Day 1: the article gets published on the first 5 child sites
-   Day 2: nothing gets published
-   Day 3: nothing gets published
-   Day 4: nothing gets published
-   Day 5: nothing gets published
-   Day 6: nothing gets published
-   Day 7: nothing gets published
-   Day 8: the article gets published on the second 5 child sites
-   Day 9: nothing gets published
-   Day 10: nothing gets published
-   Day 11: nothing gets published
-   Day 12: nothing gets published
-   Day 13: nothing gets published
-   Day 14: nothing gets published
-   Day 15: the article gets published on the third 5 child sites
-   ...
-   Day 22: the article gets published on the last 5 child sites

#### Important Notes

If you want to make sure that WP Cron jobs are regularly triggered on your MainWP Dashboard, you can Authorize the Uptime Robot service and add your dashboard site as a monitor. The Uptime Robot will ping your dashboard site regularly and make sure that all scheduled events are occurring.
