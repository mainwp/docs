</Info>

The [MainWP Boilerplate Extension](https://mainwp.com/add-on/boilerplate/) gives you the ability to easily create repetitive pages or posts on your child sites. Using the available placeholders (**Tokens**), these pages can be customized for each site without needing to be rewritten. The Boilerplate extension is the perfect solution for commonly repeated pages such as:

-   Privacy Policy
-   About Us
-   Terms of Use
-   Support Policy

or any other page with standard text that needs to be distributed across multiple websites.

## How does the Boilerplate Extension Work?

After installing the extension, you can create custom placeholders (Tokens) that you will need in your commonly used pages and posts. For each of your child sites, add values for the tokens. When you are done with the setup, you can create one page with these placeholders and post it to all wanted sites. On each child site, the placeholders will be replaced with the custom values for the site. All your Boilerplate Pages and Posts will be saved and fully editable. With just a few clicks, you will be able to tweak a page on all your sites at once.

## Boilerplate Tokens

Boilerplate pages use tokens to be customized for each site without needing to be rewritten. Basically, in the source post, instead of using actual data, you can place tokens. After publishing, tokens will be replaced by actual values on each child site. The MainWP Boilerplate extension comes with a set of default tokens and the ability to create custom tokens. For both default and custom tokens, it is required to set values for each child site individually, which will replace the token on child sites after publishing a boilerplate post or page.

## Default Boilerplate Tokens

After installing the MainWP Boilerplate Extension, on the **MainWP > Extensions > Boilerplate > Custom Tokens** page, you will be able to see the section with available tokens. ![Default Boilerplate tokens list with descriptions](/images/add-ons/boilerplate-create.jpg) Along with a token, on the right-hand side, you can see the token description so you can get an idea of what to use it for.

    3.  Click the **Save** button

When creating a new token, **do not use \[ \] symbols**. The Boilerplate extension will add them automatically.

Avoid creating tokens that are reserved for our Clients functionality and Pro Reports extension:

`[client.city]` `[client.contact.address.1]` `[client.contact.address.2]` `[client.contact.name]` `[client.email]` `[client.name]` `[client.phone]` `[client.site.name]` `[client.site.url]` `[client.state]` `[client.zip]` `[client.facebook]` `[client.twitter]` `[client.instagram]` `[client.linkedin]` `[client.country]` `[client.note]` `[client.created]` `[contact.role]` `[contact.email]` `[contact.phone]` `[contact.facebook]` `[contact.twitter]` `[contact.instagram]` `[contact.linkedin]`
