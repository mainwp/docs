The MainWP Cost Tracker is designed to help you efficiently manage and track costs associated with your websites within the MainWP Dashboard. This tool provides a centralized view to monitor, add, and analyze expenses, making your cost management more streamlined and effective.

## Cost Summary page

![Cost Tracker summary page](/images/add-ons/cost-tracker-summary-page.webp) Cost Summary is a widgetized page providing easy to understand, visual breakdown of all costs associated with Clients and their Child sites. Widgets can be resized, and re-arranged, and they can even be disabled in [Page Settings](https://mainwpcs.com/kb/page-settings). ![Cost Tracker monthly totals widget](/images/add-ons/cost-tracker-monthly-totals.webp) Data for some of the widgets can be exported in SVG, PNG and CSV format. Please note that only the chart data will be exported, and not the entire content of the widget.

## Manage Costs page

![Cost Tracker manage costs page](/images/add-ons/cost-tracker-manage-costs.webp) The Manage Costs page serves as a central dashboard where users can view, manage, and analyze all costs associated with their websites and clients. It provides a comprehensive summary of expenses, including recent additions, total costs, and categorization by type (e.g., subscription, one-time purchase) and by product (e.g., plugins, themes). ![Cost Tracker costs filters](/images/add-ons/cost-tracker-filters.gif) The data in the table can be **filtered** by Sites, Clients, Subscription types, Payment Methods, and more. After you've filtered the table, you can save it by clicking the **Save Segment** button and, later on, access it by clicking the **Load a Segment** button.
