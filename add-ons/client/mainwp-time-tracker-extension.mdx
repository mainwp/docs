## Introduction

The Time Tracker Extension allows users to track the work they do for their clients directly from their Dashboard or Browser Extension. The Time Tracker extension integrates seamlessly with the MainWP Clients Module, allowing users to create time-tracking entries for custom work performed for clients. This extension is particularly useful for MainWP managers who need to monitor the time dedicated to various tasks, ensuring accurate billing and reporting.

## Key Features

\- **Buckets:** Users can create "Buckets," which are pools of hours assigned specific price tags for different services offered to clients. - **Time Counting and Rounding**: Offers the ability to count time up from 0 or down from a specific time and offers rouncing of entries up or down for neat and understandable reporting. - **Flexible Settings**: Users can adjust settings globally or per client, catering to diverse client needs and billing practices.

## Description of Payment statuses

1.  **Draft** - The bill has been created but not yet finalized or sent to the recipient. This status is used for bills that are still being worked on.
2.  **Sent** - The bill has been finalized and sent to the recipient but has not yet been paid. This indicates that the bill is awaiting action from the recipient.
3.  **Pending** - The payment for the bill is pending; this can indicate awaiting payment from the recipient or that the payment process has been initiated but not yet completed.
4.  **Paid** - The bill has been fully paid. This status is used once the payment has been received and processed.
5.  **Partially Paid** - Part of the bill's amount has been paid, but there is still an outstanding balance.
6.  **Overdue** - The bill has not been paid by the due date. This status is used for bills that are past their payment deadline.
7.  **Canceled** - The bill has been canceled and is no longer valid. This status can be used if the bill was issued in error or if the services/products were not delivered as expected.
8.  **Disputed** - The recipient has disputed the bill. This status is used when there are disagreements about the bill's charges, services, or products provided.
9.  **Refunded** - The bill has been paid, but the amount paid was later refunded to the payer. This status might be used in cases of overpayment or if the services/products were found unsatisfactory and a refund was agreed upon.
10.  **Write-Off** - The bill is considered uncollectible and has been written off as a loss. This status is used for bills that have not been paid for an extended period, and the issuer has decided not to pursue collection further.
