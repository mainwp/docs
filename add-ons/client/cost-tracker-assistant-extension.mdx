This extension works alongside the main [Cost Tracker](/add-ons/client/cost-tracker-extension) extension. See that page for comprehensive cost tracking features.
</Note>

Cost Tracker Assistant adds convenience features to the Cost Tracker extension: automated notifications for expiring subscriptions and streamlined cost entry when uploading plugins or themes.

## Notifications

The notification system alerts you before subscriptions expire, giving you time to renew or find alternatives.

### Setting Up Notifications

1. Navigate to **Cost Tracker > Settings**
2. Enable **Subscription Expiration Alerts**
3. Set the notification threshold (e.g., 30 days before expiration)
4. Configure email recipients if different from default

### What Gets Tracked

Notifications trigger for any cost entry with:
- A defined renewal or expiration date
- The subscription type selected
- The notification threshold reached

You'll receive alerts via email and Dashboard notifications.

## Automation

When installing plugins or themes via ZIP upload, Cost Tracker Assistant streamlines the process of recording the purchase.

### How It Works

1. Upload a plugin or theme ZIP file through **MainWP > Plugins > Install** or **MainWP > Themes > Install**
2. Complete the installation
3. On the final step, you'll see a **Track Cost** option
4. Enter the purchase details:
   - Purchase price
   - Renewal date (if subscription)
   - Vendor name
   - License key (optional)
5. Click **Save** to add the entry to Cost Tracker

This eliminates the need to navigate to Cost Tracker separately after each purchase.
