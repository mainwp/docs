The "Jetpack Scan" Extension allows you to effortlessly scan all your Child Sites for potential vulnerabilities, get detailed information about each vulnerability, and take advantage of the one-click solution for most issues.

<Note>
The extension requires a [Jetpack Protect plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-protect/) on your Child Sites and a [Jetpack Scan subscription](https://jetpack.com/upgrade/scan/) that you can get at a discounted price from within the MainWP Dashboard. [Jetpack plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) will also work; however, unless you need other Jetpack modules, the Jetpack Protect plugin is preferred.
</Note>

## Installing the extension

The first step is to install Jetpack Protect plugin and activate the Jetpack Scan feature. Please follow [Jetpack's help article](https://jetpack.com/support/activate-a-jetpack-product-via-license-key/) for details on how to do so.

## Connect extension to Jetpack App

[Access your WordPress.com Developer account](https://developer.wordpress.com/apps/new/) and fill in the form in order to create an application.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/add-ons/jetpack-scan-create-wp-app.png" alt="Screenshot of WordPress.com application creation form" />
</Frame>

The value for the Redirect URL field can be found on the **Dashboard > Extensions > Jetpack Scan > Add App** page.

## Manage multiple apps

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/add-ons/40ef4c74a913.png" alt="Screenshot of Add App page showing app configuration form" />
</Frame>

To add multiple apps, simply repeat the process on the **Add App** page. All added apps can be managed on the Manage Apps page.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/add-ons/49593723df79.png" alt="Screenshot of Manage Apps page showing connected apps with action buttons" />
</Frame>

From here, Access to the account can be requested again, or the App can be removed from the extension.

## Overview page

The table on the overview page displays all the sites on which the Jetpack Scan is active. The **WP, Plugins and Themes** columns show the number of vulnerabilities found in the respective categories.

The **ellipsis menu** reveals additional actions, such as the ability to hide the Jetpack plugin on the child site and the ability to update the Jetpack plugin. The **Bulk Actions** menu provides the same actions for multiple child sites at once.

<Frame>

</Frame>

## Request a scan

### For a single-site

Locate the desired child site in the table, and select the **Request Re-scan Now** action from the ellipsis menu.

<Frame>

</Frame>

## Remote server credentials

Before Jetpack Scan can attempt to fix threats on a child site, it needs to have SSH, SFTP, or FTP server credentials for that child site. This will be indicated by the red X or green checkmark icon in the **Credentials column** in the table on the **Overview page**.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/add-ons/jetpack-scan-credentials-column.png" alt="Screenshot showing Credentials column with red X and green checkmark indicators" />
</Frame>

To add SSH, SFTP or FTP server credentials for child sites, please follow the steps outlined in this [help article](https://jetpack.com/support/backup/backups-via-the-jetpack-plugin/adding-credentials-to-jetpack/). After doing so, click the **Sync Jetpack Scan Data** button to fetch the latest Jetpack Scan data.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/add-ons/jetpack-scan-sync-data-button.png" alt="Screenshot highlighting the Sync Jetpack Scan Data button" />
</Frame>

## Manage Threats

Threats are managed on the **Threats** page. The page will list all of your sites that have Jetpack Scan active, and the vulnerabilities for WP Core, Plugins and Themes will be shown in the last three columns.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/add-ons/jetpack-scan-threats-page.png" alt="Screenshot of Threats page showing child sites with vulnerability counts by category" />
</Frame>

To manage threats, click on any vulnerability count in the table, expand the specific threat, and then choose to either **Ignore threat** or **Fix threat.**

<Note>
Fixing a threat relies on the Jetpack API and may take multiple minutes to complete. You can leave this page and come back at a later time. Depending on the Jetpack products active on a child site, a Backup may also be performed before an attempted fix, and the process can take several minutes to complete.
</Note>

<Frame>

</Frame>

## History page

After you've either ignored or fixed a threat, the threat will be visible on the **History page**. The layout of the page is identical to the **Threats page,** so simply click on a vulnerability count of a desired child site to see the history of threat management.
