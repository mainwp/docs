The Dashboard Insights module introduces a comprehensive analytics feature to the MainWP Dashboard, enabling in-depth insights into your usage and activity on the MainWP Dashboard, the performance and status of all connected Child Sites at a glance.

## **Widgetized Dashboard**

Similar to the MainWP Overview page, the Insights page is widgetized, allowing for a flexible and customizable experience. Users can show or hide widgets and remember the positions of these widgets for a tailored dashboard that fits their specific needs. ![Dashboard Insights -- widgetized page](/images/add-ons/43a6fc94702a.png)

## **Comprehensive Filtering Options**

The module offers extensive filtering capabilities, including date ranges (Today, Yesterday, This Week, Last Week, This Month, Last Month, This Year, All Time, and Custom range) and the ability to select specific Tags, Clients, or Users. This ensures that users can drill down to the exact data they need. ![Filtering options](/images/add-ons/dashboard-insights-filters.gif)
