## WordFence Settings

### Global Settings

The Wordfence Settings tab enables you to control the Wordfence options across all your child sites. It allows you to set:

-   Scan Schedule
-   Basic Settings
-   Alerts
-   Live Traffic View
-   Scans to Include
-   Firewall Rules
-   Login Security Options
-   Other Options

### Saving the Wordfence options will overwrite options on your child sites.

**If you add the Wordfence plugin on more child sites, after setting Wordfence options, you will need to re-save settings to apply on newly added child sites.**

### Individual Site Settings

The extension enables you to set Wordfence options individually on a per-site basis. To do this,

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the wanted child site in the Manage sites list">
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Edit link in the Actions menu">
</Step>
<Step title="Scroll down and locate the Wordfence section">
</Step>
<Step title="Locate the Override General Settings option in the Wordfence Settings box">
</Step>
<Step title="Set to YES">
</Step>
<Step title="Use the rest of the Wordfence section to set your preferences">
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Save Settings button at the bottom of the page.">
</Step>
</Steps>


## Wordfence Dashboard

From the **MainWP > Extensions > Wordfence > Overview page****,** you can monitor all of your child sites where you have the Wordfence plugin installed. In the sites list, you will be notified if the plugin has an update available or if the plugin is deactivated.

-   In case the plugin is not activated, the **Activate** action will appear in the corresponding site row
-   In case there is a new version of the plugin, the **Update** action will appear in the corresponding site row

### Available Actions

From the **MainWP > Extensions > Wordfence > Overview page****,** you can **hide/unhide** the Wordfence plugin on your child sites, quickly **access** the plugin settings on a child site or the WP Admin section. Actions are provided in the actions menu.

#### Important Notes

If you know that you have the plugin installed on a child site, but the child site doesn't appear in the list, try to re-sync your sites.
