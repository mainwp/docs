Jetpack Protect extension allows you to see any vulnerabilities on your child sites directly in your MainWP Dashboard. The extension works in tandem with the [Jetpack Protect](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-protect/) plugin on your child sites. Both the extension and the plugin are free to download and use.

<Note>
Jetpack Protect automatically scans your child sites once per day. This means that after resolving vulnerability issues, it can take up to 24 hours before the extension reflects changes.
