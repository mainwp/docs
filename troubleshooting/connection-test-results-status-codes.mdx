title: Connection test results (HTTP Status Codes)
description: >-
  Reference guide for HTTP status codes returned by MainWP connection tests.
  Covers 2xx success codes, 3xx redirections, 4xx client errors like 403 and
  404, and 5xx server errors to help diagnose connection issues.
---

When you run a connection test in MainWP, the result includes an HTTP status code that indicates whether the request succeeded or failed. This reference helps you interpret those codes and understand what action to take.

## What You'll Learn

- Interpret HTTP status codes from connection tests
- Identify which codes indicate success vs. failure
- Understand common causes for specific error codes
- Determine next steps based on the status code

## Prerequisites

- MainWP Dashboard installed and activated
- A child site you're testing connection to

---

## How to Run a Connection Test

Go to **MainWP > Sites > Manage Sites**, find the site, and click **Test Connection** from the site's action menu. The result displays the HTTP status code returned by the child site server.

## 2xx – Success Codes

These codes indicate the request was received and processed successfully.

| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 200 | OK | Standard response for successful HTTP requests |
| 201 | Created | Request has been fulfilled; new resource created |
| 202 | Accepted | Request accepted, processing pending. **Note:** On SiteGround, this may indicate a captcha challenge blocking MainWP |
| 203 | Non-Authoritative Information | Request processed, information may be from another source |
| 204 | No Content | Request processed, no content returned |
| 205 | Reset Content | Request processed, no content returned, reset the document view |
| 206 | Partial Content | Partial resource return due to the request header |
| 207 | Multi-Status | XML can contain multiple separate responses |
| 208 | Already Reported | Results previously returned |
| 226 | IM Used | Request fulfilled, the response is instance-manipulations |

**200 OK** is the expected result for a successful connection test.

## 3xx – Redirection Codes

These codes indicate the request was redirected to another location.

| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 300 | Multiple Choices | Multiple options for the resource delivered |
| 301 | Moved Permanently | This and all future requests directed to the given URI |
| 302 | Found | Temporary response to request found via alternative URI |
| 303 | See Other | Permanent response to request found via alternative URI |
| 304 | Not Modified | Resource has not been modified since last requested |
| 305 | Use Proxy | Content located elsewhere, retrieve from there |
| 306 | Reserved | Subsequent requests should use the specified proxy |
| 307 | Temporary Redirect | Connect again to different URI as provided |
| 308 | Permanent Redirect | Resumable HTTP requests |

**Common cause:** The child site URL has changed (HTTP to HTTPS, www to non-www, or domain change). Update the site URL in MainWP to match the current address.
