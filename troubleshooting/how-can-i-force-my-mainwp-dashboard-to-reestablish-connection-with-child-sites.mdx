title: Force reconnection with child sites
description: >-
  Use the Force Reconnect tool in MainWP to regenerate OpenSSL keys and
  reestablish secure connections with all child sites when experiencing
  connection issues.
---

The Force Reconnect tool regenerates the OpenSSL encryption keys used for Dashboard-to-child communication and forces all child sites to re-authenticate. Use this when you experience persistent connection issues that other troubleshooting steps haven't resolved.

## What You'll Learn

- When to use Force Reconnect
- How to trigger the reconnection process
- What happens during reconnection

## Prerequisites

- MainWP Dashboard installed and activated
- Child sites previously connected to your Dashboard
- Admin access to your Dashboard

---

## When to Use Force Reconnect

Use this tool when:

- Multiple child sites suddenly show connection errors
- You've migrated your Dashboard to a new server or domain
- SSL/TLS configuration has changed on your Dashboard
- Connection issues persist after resolving firewall or server problems
- OpenSSL keys may have become corrupted or out of sync

<Warning>
Force Reconnect affects all child sites. The Dashboard will temporarily lose connection with sites while regenerating keys. Sites will reconnect automatically during the next sync.
</Warning>

## Force Reconnection

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to MainWP Tools">
Go to **MainWP > Settings > MainWP Tools**.
</Step>
<Step title="Find Force Reconnect">
Locate the **Force your MainWP Dashboard to establish a new connection** option.
</Step>
<Step title="Click the button">
Click the **Force Reconnect** button.
</Step>
<Step title="Wait for completion">
The Dashboard regenerates OpenSSL keys and marks all child sites for reconnection. This process runs automatically.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify connections">
Go to **MainWP > Sites > Manage Sites** and verify that sites are reconnecting. You can manually sync individual sites to speed up the process.
</Step>
</Steps>

## What Happens During Reconnection

1. **Key regeneration** - The Dashboard creates new OpenSSL public/private key pairs
2. **Site marking** - All child sites are flagged for reconnection
3. **Automatic sync** - During the next sync cycle, each child site receives the new public key
4. **Re-authentication** - Child sites verify the new keys and reestablish secure communication

The process is automatic once triggered. Sites reconnect during their normal sync schedule or when you manually sync them.

## Self-Check Checklist

- [ ] Force Reconnect button clicked
- [ ] Dashboard shows sites are reconnecting
- [ ] Previously problematic sites now connect successfully
- [ ] Sync operations complete without errors
