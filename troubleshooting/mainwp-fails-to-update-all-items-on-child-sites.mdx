title: MainWP fails to update all items on child sites
description: >-
  Troubleshoot failed updates caused by server requirements, plugin conflicts,
  or MainWP settings. Check PHP memory, execution time, cURL timeout, and
  adjust simultaneous request settings for your setup.
---

When bulk updates fail to complete on some or all child sites, the cause is typically insufficient server resources, plugin conflicts, or settings that don't match your hosting environment.

## What You'll Learn

- Check if system requirements are met
- Identify plugin conflicts blocking updates
- Adjust MainWP settings for your setup
- Troubleshoot premium plugin update failures

## Prerequisites

- MainWP Dashboard installed and activated
- Admin access to Dashboard and child sites
- Ability to modify PHP settings (or host support)

---

## Check System Requirements

Bulk updates require sufficient time and memory on both your Dashboard and child sites. These values often need increasing from defaults.

### Key Settings to Check

| Setting | Recommended Minimum | Where to Check |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| PHP Memory Limit | 256M | MainWP > Info > Server |
| WordPress Memory Limit | 256M | MainWP > Info > Server |
| PHP Max Execution Time | 300 seconds | MainWP > Info > Server |
| cURL Timeout | 300 seconds | MainWP > Info > Server |

### How to Increase These Values

<Steps>
<Step title="Check current values">
Go to **MainWP > Info > Server** to see current PHP and WordPress settings.
</Step>
<Step title="Update Dashboard settings">
Contact your Dashboard hosting provider or edit php.ini/wp-config.php to increase limits.
</Step>
<Step title="Update child site settings">
Repeat the same increases on child sites experiencing update failures.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Running MainWP on shared hosting often causes update failures due to strict resource limits. Consider VPS or managed WordPress hosting for better performance. [Read more about hosting considerations](https://managers.mainwp.com/t/why-are-you-still-using-shared-hosting-in-2023/2873).
</Warning>

## Check for Plugin Conflicts

Security and caching plugins sometimes interfere with update processes.

<Steps>
<Step title="Identify problem sites">
Note which child sites fail to update.
</Step>
<Step title="Temporarily disable plugins">
On a failing child site, temporarily deactivate security and caching plugins.
</Step>
<Step title="Test updates">
Run updates again from your Dashboard.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify the conflict">
If updates succeed, re-enable plugins one at a time to identify which one causes the conflict.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure the plugin">
Adjust the conflicting plugin's settings to allow MainWP operations, or contact the plugin developer for guidance.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Common Conflicting Plugin Types

- Security plugins (Wordfence, Sucuri, Solid Security)
- Caching plugins (WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, LiteSpeed Cache)
- Firewall plugins (NinjaFirewall, BulletProof Security)

## Adjust MainWP Settings

If system requirements are met and plugins aren't the issue, fine-tune MainWP's request handling.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Advanced Options">
Go to **MainWP > Settings > Advanced Options**.
</Step>
<Step title="Reduce simultaneous requests">
Lower the **Maximum Simultaneous Requests** value. Try reducing by half.
</Step>
<Step title="Reduce simultaneous update requests">
Lower the **Maximum Simultaneous Update Requests** value.
</Step>
<Step title="Add delays between requests">
Increase the **Minimum Delay Between Requests** value.
</Step>
<Step title="Test and iterate">
Save settings and test updates. Repeat the process, adjusting values until you find settings that work reliably for your setup.
</Step>
</Steps>

| Setting | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| Maximum Simultaneous Requests | How many sites MainWP contacts at once during sync |
| Maximum Simultaneous Update Requests | How many sites receive updates at once |
| Minimum Delay Between Requests | Pause between batches of requests |

## Troubleshoot Premium Plugin Failures

If only premium plugins fail to update:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| License not activated | Activate the license on the child site |
| License expired | Renew the license with the plugin vendor |
| Update server unreachable | Check the premium plugin's status page |
| API credentials missing | Enter API keys in the plugin's settings |

## Get Support

If you've tried all steps and updates still fail, [open a helpdesk ticket](https://mainwp.com/my-account/get-support/) with:

- Screenshots of Server Information page
- List of plugins on the failing child site
- Description of which updates fail (all, specific plugins, premium only)

## Self-Check Checklist

- [ ] Server Information shows adequate PHP memory and execution time
- [ ] Child sites also have adequate resource limits
- [ ] Security and caching plugins temporarily disabled for testing
- [ ] Advanced Options adjusted for fewer simultaneous requests
- [ ] Premium plugin licenses are active (if applicable)
- [ ] Updates complete successfully after adjustments
