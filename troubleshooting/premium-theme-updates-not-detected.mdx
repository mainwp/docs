  Troubleshoot and fix premium theme update detection issues in MainWP
  Dashboard using custom filters for improved compatibility with third-party
  update APIs.
---

MainWP supports premium themes that use the standard WordPress Update API. When premium theme updates aren't detected, it's typically because the theme uses a custom update mechanism that requires additional configuration.

## What You'll Learn

- Troubleshoot missing premium theme updates
- Determine if the issue is with WordPress or MainWP
- Add custom filters to improve detection
- Handle multiple problematic themes

## Prerequisites

- MainWP Dashboard installed and activated
- Premium theme installed on child sites
- Admin access to Dashboard and child sites

---

## Troubleshooting Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Check WordPress detection">
Log in to the child site and go to **Dashboard > Updates**. Check if WordPress detects the available theme update.
</Step>
<Step title="Evaluate the result">
Based on what you see:

| WordPress Shows Update | Action |
|------------------------|--------|
| Yes | Resync your sites in MainWP. If still not showing, see Enhance Compatibility below. |
| No | Try refreshing the Updates page on the child site. If updates still don't appear, contact the theme author. |
</Step>
<Step title="Resync sites">
In MainWP, go to **MainWP > Sites > Manage Sites** and sync the child site. Check if the theme update now appears in MainWP.
</Step>
</Steps>

If updates show in WordPress but not in MainWP after syncing, use the compatibility filters below.

---

## Enhance Compatibility

MainWP provides two custom filters for themes that use non-standard update APIs:

| Filter | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `mainwp_detect_premium_themes_update` | Improves detection of available updates |
| `mainwp_request_update_premium_themes` | Improves the update process |

### Add the Compatibility Filters

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Custom Dashboard Extension">
If not already installed, go to **MainWP > Extensions** and install the [Custom Dashboard Extension](https://mainwp.com/extension/mainwp-custom-dashboard-extension/).
</Step>
<Step title="Add the code snippet">
Go to the Custom Dashboard extension settings and add this code to the **PHP Section**:

```php
// Improves detection of available updates for premium themes
add_filter( 'mainwp_detect_premium_themes_update', 'hook_mainwp_detect_premium_themes_update' );
function hook_mainwp_detect_premium_themes_update( $premiums = array() ){
    $premiums[] = 'theme-slug';
    return $premiums;
}

// Improves the update process of premium themes
add_filter( 'mainwp_request_update_premium_themes', 'hook_mainwp_request_update_premium_themes' );
function hook_mainwp_request_update_premium_themes( $premiums = array() ){
    $premiums[] = 'theme-slug';
    return $premiums;
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Replace the theme slug">
Replace `theme-slug` with the actual slug of the problematic theme. To find the slug, check the theme's folder name in `/wp-content/themes/` or contact the theme author.
</Step>
<Step title="Save and resync">
Save the code snippet and resync your sites.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Multiple Themes

If you have multiple themes with detection issues, add each slug to the arrays:

```php
// Improves detection of available updates for premium themes
add_filter( 'mainwp_detect_premium_themes_update', 'hook_mainwp_detect_premium_themes_update' );
function hook_mainwp_detect_premium_themes_update( $premiums = array() ){
    $premiums[] = 'theme-slug-1';
    $premiums[] = 'theme-slug-2';
    $premiums[] = 'theme-slug-3';
    return $premiums;
}

// Improves the update process of premium themes
add_filter( 'mainwp_request_update_premium_themes', 'hook_mainwp_request_update_premium_themes' );
function hook_mainwp_request_update_premium_themes( $premiums = array() ){
    $premiums[] = 'theme-slug-1';
    $premiums[] = 'theme-slug-2';
    $premiums[] = 'theme-slug-3';
    return $premiums;
}
```

### Alternative: functions.php

If you prefer not to use the Custom Dashboard extension, add the code to the `functions.php` file of your Dashboard site's active theme.

<Warning>
Adding code to your theme's functions.php will be lost if the theme is updated. The Custom Dashboard extension is the recommended approach.
</Warning>

## When Updates Still Don't Work

Some theme authors use completely custom update APIs that aren't compatible with WordPress standards. In these cases:

1. [Open a support ticket](https://mainwp.com/my-account/get-support/) with MainWP
2. Contact the theme author to request WordPress-standard update support
3. Consider updating the theme manually on child sites

---

## Self-Check Checklist

- [ ] Verified WordPress detects the update on the child site
- [ ] Resynced child sites in MainWP
- [ ] Added compatibility filters (if needed)
- [ ] Replaced theme-slug with actual theme slug
- [ ] Theme updates now appear in MainWP
