  Troubleshoot Jump to WP Admin issues caused by security plugins, WWW prefix
  mismatches, or HTTP/HTTPS protocol differences. Adjust security plugin
  settings and verify Site URL matches the actual URL.

Jump to WP Admin lets you open a child site's WordPress admin area directly from your MainWP Dashboard, automatically logged in as the administrator account used during connection. When this feature doesn't work, security plugins or URL mismatches are typically the cause.

## WWW Prefix Mismatch

The site URL in MainWP must exactly match the actual URL of the child site, including whether it uses the WWW prefix.

| Site Actual URL | MainWP Site URL | Result |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| example.com | example.com | Works |
| www.example.com | www.example.com | Works |
| example.com | www.example.com | **Fails** |
| www.example.com | example.com | **Fails** |

### Fix WWW Settings

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to site settings">
Go to **MainWP > Sites > Manage Sites**, find the child site, and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step title="Adjust WWW setting">
Locate the **www** dropdown and select the appropriate option:
- **Use if required** - Adds www if the site uses it
- **Do not use** - Removes www

## HTTP/HTTPS Protocol Mismatch

The site URL must match the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) the site actually uses.

|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| HTTPS | https://example.com | Works |
| HTTP | http://example.com | Works |
| HTTPS | http://example.com | **Fails** |
| HTTP | https://example.com | **Fails** |

### Fix Protocol Settings

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to site settings">
Go to **MainWP > Sites > Manage Sites**, find the child site, and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step title="Adjust protocol setting">
Locate the **https://** dropdown and select the appropriate protocol for your site.

<Step title="Save settings">
Click **Save Settings** at the bottom of the page.
</Step>
<Step title="Test Jump to WP Admin">
Try the Jump to WP Admin feature again.
