title: Why can't I edit email templates in my MainWP Dashboard?
sidebarTitle: "Email Template Editing"
description: >-
  Email template changes not saving may be caused by DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT in
  wp-config.php. Remove or set this constant to false to enable template editing
  through the MainWP Dashboard interface.
---

When editing email templates in MainWP (such as Uptime Monitoring notifications), changes may not save and content resets after refreshing the page. This is typically caused by a WordPress security setting.

## What You'll Learn

- Why email template changes don't save
- How to check if file editing is disabled
- How to enable template editing

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Dashboard site
- FTP or file manager access to edit wp-config.php

---

## Why This Happens

WordPress includes a security constant that prevents editing theme and plugin files through the admin interface. When enabled, this setting also blocks MainWP from saving email template changes.

The constant in wp-config.php:

```php
define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true);
```

This setting is often added by:
- Security plugins
- Managed WordPress hosts
- Security-conscious server administrators

---

## Check if File Editing is Disabled

You can determine if this setting is enabled by looking for these options in your Dashboard site's WP Admin:

| Menu Location | If Visible | If Missing |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| Plugins > Plugin File Editor | File editing enabled | File editing disabled |
| Appearance > Theme File Editor | File editing enabled | File editing disabled |

If both menu items are missing, `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` is set to `true`.

## Enable Email Template Editing

<Steps>
<Step title="Access wp-config.php">
Connect to your Dashboard site via FTP or your hosting file manager and open `wp-config.php`.
</Step>
<Step title="Find the constant">
Search for this line:

```php
define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true);
```
</Step>
<Step title="Modify or remove">
Either remove the line completely, or change `true` to `false`:

```php
define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', false);
```
</Step>
<Step title="Save the file">
Save wp-config.php and upload it back to your server.
</Step>
<Step title="Test template editing">
Return to your MainWP Dashboard and try editing an email template. Changes should now save successfully.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Security Considerations

The `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` constant exists for security reasons—it prevents attackers who gain admin access from modifying code through the WordPress interface.

### Alternative Approaches

If you prefer to keep file editing disabled for security:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Edit via FTP | Modify template files directly on the server |
| Temporarily enable | Enable only when editing templates, then disable again |
| Use child theme | Override templates via a child theme |

## Self-Check Checklist

- [ ] Checked for Plugin/Theme File Editor in WP Admin menus
- [ ] Located DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT in wp-config.php
- [ ] Modified or removed the constant
- [ ] Email template changes now save successfully
