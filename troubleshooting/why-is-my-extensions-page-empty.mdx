title: Why is my Extensions page empty?
description: >-
  Browser extensions may auto-fill the Search Installed Extensions field,
  filtering out all extensions and making the page appear empty. Delete any
  auto-filled text in the search field to reveal your extensions.

When the Extensions page appears empty even though you have extensions installed, it's usually caused by browser password managers auto-filling the search field.

## Why This Happens

Browser password managers sometimes misidentify the Search and API Key fields as username/password fields. When they auto-fill these fields with saved credentials, the search filter applies to your extension list.

Since your auto-filled username likely doesn't match any extension name, all extensions are filtered out and the page appears empty.

This is more common when your API key hasn't been saved yet.

## Prevent Auto-Fill Issues

### Option 1: Exclude MainWP from Password Manager

Configure your browser's password manager to not save or fill credentials for your MainWP Dashboard URL.

### Option 2: Use a Different Browser

If you consistently experience this issue, try accessing your Dashboard with a different browser or in incognito/private mode.

### Option 3: Disable Browser Auto-Fill

Temporarily disable your browser's auto-fill feature when working in MainWP:

| Browser | How to Disable |
|---------|----------------|
| Chrome | Settings > Autofill > Passwords > Toggle off |
| Firefox | Settings > Privacy & Security > Logins and Passwords |
| Safari | Preferences > Auto-fill |
| Edge | Settings > Profiles > Passwords |

## Extensions Still Missing?

If clearing the search field doesn't reveal your extensions:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Extensions not installed | Install from **WP Admin > Plugins > Add New** |
| Extensions deactivated | Activate on **WP Admin > Plugins** page |
| Wrong Dashboard site | Verify you're logged into the correct Dashboard |
| Browser cache | Clear browser cache and refresh |
