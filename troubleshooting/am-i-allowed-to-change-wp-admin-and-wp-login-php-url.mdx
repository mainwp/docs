title: Can I change wp-admin and wp-login.php URLs?
sidebarTitle: "Custom Admin URLs"
description: >-
  MainWP supports custom wp-admin and wp-login.php URLs on child sites. Custom
  wp-admin paths work automatically, while custom login URLs are supported on
  both Dashboard and child sites.
---

MainWP is compatible with sites that use custom WordPress admin and login URLs. This is common when using security plugins that rename these paths to reduce brute force attacks.

## What You'll Learn

- Whether MainWP supports custom admin URLs
- Which changes are safe on child sites vs. Dashboard
- How MainWP handles custom paths automatically

## Prerequisites

- MainWP Dashboard installed
- Understanding of which plugin modifies your login/admin URLs

---

## Custom wp-admin Path

MainWP supports customized `/wp-admin/` paths on child sites.

### How It Works

When connecting to a child site, MainWP attempts to reach `http://url.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`. If that fails, it automatically retries with `http://url.com`. This fallback mechanism allows MainWP to work with most custom wp-admin configurations.

### Compatibility Summary

| Location | Custom wp-admin | Supported |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Child sites | Changed path | Yes |
| Dashboard | Changed path | **No** - may cause issues |

<Warning>
Do not change the wp-admin path on your MainWP Dashboard site. This can cause various issues with Dashboard functionality. Only change wp-admin on child sites.
</Warning>

## Custom wp-login.php URL

MainWP supports renamed `wp-login.php` URLs on both child sites and your Dashboard.

### Compatibility Summary

| Location | Custom login URL | Supported |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Child sites | Renamed login | Yes |
| Dashboard | Renamed login | Yes |

Common plugins that rename wp-login.php:
- WPS Hide Login
- Rename wp-login.php
- iThemes Security (now Solid Security)
- All-In-One Security

## Common Issues

### Jump to WP Admin Not Working

If Jump to WP Admin doesn't work after changing login URLs:

1. Clear your browser cache
2. Verify the security plugin allows external logins
3. Check that the URL in MainWP matches the actual site URL
4. See [Troubleshoot Jump to WP Admin](/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-issues-with-jump-to-the-site-wp-admin-functionality)

### Connection Fails After Changing Paths

If your site stops connecting after changing admin paths:

1. Ensure the MainWP Child plugin is still active
2. Verify the site is accessible at its new path
3. Resync the site from your Dashboard
4. Check server error logs for blocked requests

## Self-Check Checklist

- [ ] Custom paths only changed on child sites (not Dashboard wp-admin)
- [ ] Sites remain connected after path changes
- [ ] Jump to WP Admin works (or using alternative access)
- [ ] Security plugin configured to allow MainWP operations
