## What You'll Learn

- Why this notice appears
- How to connect a new site to your Dashboard
- How to reconnect a disconnected site
- When to deactivate the plugin

## Why This Notice Appears

The notice displays in two situations:

| Situation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| New installation | You activated MainWP Child but haven't added the site to your Dashboard yet |
| Disconnected site | The site was previously connected but lost its connection (after plugin deactivation, site migration, or Dashboard changes) |

The plugin is designed to communicate with a MainWP Dashboard. Until connected, it displays this reminder to complete the setup.

</Step>
<Step title="Navigate to Add New Site">
Go to **MainWP > Sites > Add New**.
</Step>
<Step title="Enter site details">

## Reconnect a Disconnected Site

If the site was previously connected but became disconnected:

<Steps>
<Step title="Log in to your Dashboard">
Access your MainWP Dashboard WordPress site.
</Step>

If the site no longer appears in your Dashboard, you may need to add it as a new site.
