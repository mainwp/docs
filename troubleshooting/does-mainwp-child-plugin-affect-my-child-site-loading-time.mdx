## Why There's No Performance Impact

The MainWP Child plugin is designed to have minimal footprint on frontend performance:

- **Backend-only processing** - The plugin primarily handles admin-side operations
- **No frontend scripts** - No JavaScript or CSS added to public-facing pages
- **Request-based activation** - Code only runs when the Dashboard communicates with the site
- **Optimized queries** - Database interactions are minimized and optimized

Normal visitors to your site won't experience any slowdown from having MainWP Child installed.
