sidebarTitle: "Ports and User Agent"
description: >-
  MainWP Dashboard communicates using port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS.
  The User-Agent is Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MainWP/VERSION; +http://mainwp.com)
  with VERSION changing per release.

MainWP Dashboard communicates with child sites using standard web ports and a specific User-Agent string. This information is essential when configuring firewalls, security plugins, or troubleshooting blocked connections.

## What You'll Learn

- Network ports used by MainWP
- The exact User-Agent string format
- When you need this information

---

## Network Ports

MainWP uses standard HTTP/HTTPS ports for all communication:

| Protocol | Port | Usage |
|----------|------|-------|
| HTTP | 80 | Unencrypted connections (not recommended) |
| HTTPS | 443 | Encrypted connections (recommended) |

MainWP does not use custom ports. If your child site is accessible via a web browser, MainWP can communicate with it using the same ports.

---

## User-Agent String

MainWP identifies itself with this User-Agent when connecting to child sites:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MainWP/5.4.0.16; +http://mainwp.com)
```

The version number (`5.4.0.16` in this example) changes with each MainWP Dashboard release. The format remains consistent:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MainWP/[VERSION]; +http://mainwp.com)
```

## When You Need This Information

### Firewall Configuration

If your hosting provider or server firewall blocks unknown traffic, whitelist:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Ports | 80, 443 |
| User-Agent pattern | `MainWP/*` or `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MainWP` |

### Security Plugin Rules

Some security plugins (Wordfence, Sucuri, iThemes Security) may block requests from unfamiliar User-Agents. Add MainWP's User-Agent to your allowlist if connections fail.

### Troubleshooting Blocked Connections

If child sites won't connect, check:

1. **Server logs** for blocked requests containing "MainWP" in the User-Agent
2. **Firewall logs** for denied connections on ports 80/443
3. **Security plugin logs** for blocked bot traffic
