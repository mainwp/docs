20i hosting uses a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that may block MainWP Dashboard connection requests. The solution requires contacting 20i support to whitelist your Dashboard's IP address or User-Agent.

## What You'll Learn

- Identify when 20i's WAF is blocking connections
- Find your Dashboard IP address and User-Agent
- Request a whitelist from 20i support

## Prerequisites

- MainWP Dashboard installed and activated
- A child site hosted on 20i
- Your Dashboard IP address

---

## Symptoms

You may be experiencing 20i WAF blocking if:

- Connection attempts time out or fail
- Error message states "MainWP Child plugin not detected"
- Connection test returns a 403 or 406 status code
- Other child sites connect successfully but 20i-hosted sites don't

## Find Your Dashboard Information

Before contacting 20i support, gather the required information.

### Dashboard IP Address

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Server Information">
In your MainWP Dashboard, go to **MainWP > Info > Server**.
</Step>
<Step title="Locate Server IP">
Find the **Server IP** field and note the IP address.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If the Server IP shows a local address (like 127.0.0.x or 10.x.x.x), contact your Dashboard hosting provider to get the external IP address. Alternatively, check your hosting control panel for the server's public IP.
</Note>

### MainWP User-Agent

MainWP uses this User-Agent string for all requests:

```text
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MainWP/4.0; +http://mainwp.com)
```
