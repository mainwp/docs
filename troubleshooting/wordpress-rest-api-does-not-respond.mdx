title: WordPress REST API does not respond
description: >-
  REST API not responding is usually caused by disabled API, Plain permalinks,
  or security plugins blocking access. Check permalink settings and review
  security plugins that can disable the REST API.
---

The WordPress REST API enables MainWP features like the browser extension, external integrations, and certain Dashboard functions. When the REST API is blocked or disabled, these features won't work.

## What You'll Learn

- Check if the REST API is accessible
- Fix permalink settings that block REST API
- Identify plugins that disable REST API
- Resolve server-level REST API blocks

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your WordPress site
- Ability to access plugin settings
- Access to wp-config.php (for server-level fixes)

---

## Check if REST API is Blocked

Visit this URL in your browser (replace with your actual domain):

```text
https://your-site.com/wp-json/
```

**If working:** You'll see a JSON response with site information and available endpoints.

**If blocked:** You'll see an error message like:

```json
{
  "code": "rest_cannot_access",
  "message": "DRA: Only authenticated users can access the REST API.",
  "data": {"status": 401}
}
```

## Fix Permalink Settings

The REST API requires non-Plain permalinks due to a WordPress limitation.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open permalink settings">
Go to **WP Admin > Settings > Permalinks**.
</Step>
<Step title="Select a non-Plain structure">
Choose any option except **Plain** (the first option).

</Step>
<Step title="Save changes">
Click **Save Changes**.
</Step>
<Step title="Test REST API">
Visit `https://your-site.com/wp-json/` again to verify it's now working.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Check for Plugins Disabling REST API

Security and performance plugins often include options to disable the REST API. While this rarely improves security or performance, some users enable it.

### Plugins That Can Disable REST API

| Category | Plugins |
|----------|---------|
| Security | Solid Security (iThemes), Wordfence, All-In-One Security (AIOS), Sucuri, Shield Security, BulletProof Security, NinjaFirewall, Titan Anti-spam & Security |
| Performance | Perfmatters, Swift Performance, Clearfy Cache |
| Privacy/Hiding | WP Hide & Security Enhancer, Hide My WP Ghost, Password Protected |
| REST API Control | Disable REST API, WP REST API Controller, WP OAuth Server |
| CDN/Firewall | Cloudflare WAF |

<Note>
These plugins don't disable REST API by default. If you have any installed, check their settings for REST API options.
</Note>

### Find the Blocking Plugin

<Steps>
<Step title="Deactivate plugins">
Deactivate security and performance plugins one at a time.
</Step>
<Step title="Test after each">
After each deactivation, test `https://your-site.com/wp-json/` to see if REST API responds.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify the culprit">
When REST API starts working, you've found the plugin causing the block.
</Step>
<Step title="Adjust plugin settings">
In that plugin's settings, look for REST API options and enable API access. You may be able to whitelist specific endpoints rather than disabling the block entirely.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Server-Level Restrictions

Web server configurations (Apache or NGINX) can block REST API requests by restricting paths starting with `/wp-json/`.

### Check .htaccess (Apache)

Look in your site's `.htaccess` file for rules that might block `/wp-json/` requests.

### Check NGINX Configuration

If using NGINX, check your server configuration for location blocks that restrict `/wp-json/` access.

### Contact Your Host

If you're unable to identify the blocking rule, contact your hosting provider and ask them to verify that REST API requests are not being blocked at the server level.

## Required Endpoints for MainWP

If you're using the MainWP browser extension or REST API integrations, these endpoints must be accessible:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/mainwp/v1/sites/all-sites` | List all connected sites |
| `/mainwp/v1/sites/sites-available-updates-count` | Get update counts |
| `/mainwp/v1/site/non-mainwp-changes-count` | Track non-MainWP changes |

## REST API Security Considerations

The REST API is active by default on WordPress sites and is the standard communication protocol for modern WordPress functionality. Keeping it enabled:

- Presents no increased security risk compared to traditional methods
- Is required for Gutenberg editor, many plugins, and mobile apps
- Can be secured through proper authentication rather than disabling

---

## Self-Check Checklist

- [ ] Tested REST API by visiting /wp-json/ directly
- [ ] Verified permalink structure is not set to Plain
- [ ] Checked installed plugins for REST API disable options
- [ ] Confirmed server-level restrictions are not blocking REST API
- [ ] REST API returns JSON data when accessed
