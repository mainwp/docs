title: How to enable Error Logging?
description: >-
  Enable WordPress error logging by adding WP_DEBUG, WP_DEBUG_LOG, and
  WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY constants to wp-config.php on your MainWP Dashboard site.
  Errors will be logged to /wp-content/debug.log.
---

Error logging helps diagnose connection issues and plugin conflicts by recording PHP errors and warnings to a log file. Enable this on your MainWP Dashboard when troubleshooting problems.

## What You'll Learn

- Enable WordPress debug mode
- Configure error logging to a file
- Access and read the debug log

## Prerequisites

- FTP or file manager access to your Dashboard site
- Ability to edit wp-config.php

---

## Enable Error Logging

<Steps>
<Step title="Access wp-config.php">
Connect to your MainWP Dashboard site via FTP or your hosting file manager and open `wp-config.php`.
</Step>
<Step title="Add debug constants">
Insert the following code **before** the line `/* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */`:

```php
// Enable WP_DEBUG mode
define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );

// Enable Debug logging to the /wp-content/debug.log file
define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );

// Disable display of errors and warnings
define( 'WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false );
```
</Step>
<Step title="Save the file">
Save your changes to wp-config.php.
</Step>
</Steps>

## What Each Setting Does

| Constant | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `WP_DEBUG` | Enables debug mode, which enables error tracking |
| `WP_DEBUG_LOG` | Writes errors to `/wp-content/debug.log` |
| `WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY` | When false, hides errors from visitors while still logging them |

---

## Access the Debug Log

Find your error log at:

```text
/wp-content/debug.log
```

You can access this file via:
- FTP or SFTP
- Hosting file manager
- SSH command: `tail -f /path/to/wp-content/debug.log`

---

## Disable Error Logging

When you've finished troubleshooting, disable debug mode to improve performance and security:

```php
define( 'WP_DEBUG', false );
```

Or remove the debug constants entirely.

<Warning>
Do not leave debug mode enabled on production sites. The debug log may contain sensitive information and debug mode can affect performance.
</Warning>

- [ ] Debug constants are added to wp-config.php
- [ ] Constants are placed before the "stop editing" line
- [ ] debug.log file is being created in /wp-content/
