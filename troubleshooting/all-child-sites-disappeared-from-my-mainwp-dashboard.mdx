## Repair Database Using WP_ALLOW_REPAIR

WordPress includes a built-in database repair feature that requires minimal technical knowledge.

<Steps>
<Step title="Download wp-config.php">
Connect to your Dashboard site via FTP and download `wp-config.php` from the WordPress root folder.
</Step>
<Step title="Add the repair constant">
Open wp-config.php in a text editor and add this line before the `if ( !defined('ABSPATH') )` line:

```php
define( 'WP_ALLOW_REPAIR', true );
```

</Step>
<Step title="Upload the file">
Save the file and upload it back to your server, overwriting the existing copy.
</Step>
<Step title="Access the repair page">
In your browser, go to:

```text
https://yourdashboard.com/wp-admin/maint/repair.php
```

Replace `yourdashboard.com` with your actual Dashboard URL.

![WordPress Database Repair page with repair options](/images/troubleshooting/disappeared-sites-step4.png)
</Step>
<Step title="Run the repair">
Click **Repair and Optimize Database**. This option repairs corrupted tables and optimizes performance.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify completion">
Scroll to the bottom of the results page. You should see the message: "Repairs complete. Please remove the following line from wp-config.php to prevent this page from being used by unauthorized users."
</Step>
<Step title="Remove the repair constant">
Edit wp-config.php again and remove the `WP_ALLOW_REPAIR` line you added. Upload the file to your server.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify sites restored">
Go to **MainWP > Sites > Manage Sites** and confirm your child sites are visible again.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Always remove the WP_ALLOW_REPAIR line after repairing. Leaving it enabled allows anyone to access the repair page without authentication.
</Warning>

## Repair Database Using phpMyAdmin

If the WordPress repair method doesn't work, try repairing directly through phpMyAdmin.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open phpMyAdmin">
Log in to your hosting cPanel and open the phpMyAdmin module.
</Step>
<Step title="Select your database">
In the left sidebar, click your WordPress database name. If you're unsure which database to select, check the `DB_NAME` value in your wp-config.php file.
</Step>
<Step title="Select tables to repair">
If you know which table is corrupted, select only that table. Otherwise, click **Check all** to select all tables.

![phpMyAdmin interface showing table selection and Repair option](/images/troubleshooting/disappeared-sites-step3.png)
</Step>
<Step title="Run repair">
From the dropdown menu at the bottom, select **Repair table** and click **Go**.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify completion">
phpMyAdmin displays the repair results. Once complete, go to your Dashboard and verify your sites are restored.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Restore from Backup

If database repair doesn't resolve the issue, restore your Dashboard database from a recent backup.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access your backup">
Locate your most recent Dashboard database backup. This may be in your hosting account, a backup plugin, or an offsite backup service.
</Step>
<Step title="Restore the database">
Use phpMyAdmin, your hosting control panel, or your backup plugin to restore the database.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify restoration">
After restoring, log in to your Dashboard and verify your child sites are visible.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Restoring a backup may result in some data loss if changes were made after the backup date. Re-sync all sites after restoration to ensure current data.
</Note>
