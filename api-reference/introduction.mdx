  Programmatic access to your MainWP Dashboard through the REST API and WordPress Abilities API integration.

MainWP provides programmatic access through two distinct systems that serve different purposes.

## What You'll Learn

- The difference between the REST API and Abilities API
- When to use each API
- How authentication works across both systems

## MainWP REST API

The MainWP REST API is MainWP's native HTTP interface for external integrations. It exposes fixed endpoints for managing sites, updates, clients, tags, and costs through standard REST conventions.

**Base URL:** `https://your-dashboard.com/wp-json/mainwp/v2/`

The REST API works well for scripts, direct HTTP calls, and established automation workflows where you know exactly which endpoints to call.

## WordPress Abilities API

The Abilities API is a **WordPress-wide framework** for capability discovery and execution. It's a separate WordPress plugin that provides a standardized registry where any plugin can register discrete actions ("abilities") with defined schemas. MainWP registers 62 abilities into this framework.

**Base URL:** `https://your-dashboard.com/wp-json/wp-abilities/v1/`

The key distinction is **discoverability**. AI agents and automation tools can query the Abilities API to learn what actions are available, what parameters they accept, and what they return—all through structured JSON schemas. The REST API requires prior knowledge of endpoint paths and parameters.

## Authentication

Both systems accept the same Bearer tokens generated in your MainWP Dashboard:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://your-dashboard.com/wp-json/mainwp/v2/sites/basic"
```

Generate API keys at **Dashboard > REST API > Add API Keys**. For detailed setup, see the [REST API Setup Guide](/dashboard/overview/mainwp-rest-api).

## Requirements

| System | Requirements |
|--------|--------------|
| REST API | MainWP Dashboard accessible via HTTPS, non-Plain permalinks |
| Abilities API | REST API requirements plus MainWP v6+ and WordPress Abilities API plugin |
