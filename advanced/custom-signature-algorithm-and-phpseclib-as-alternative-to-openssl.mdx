title: Custom signature algorithm and PHPSecLib as alternative to OpenSSL
sidebarTitle: "Signature Algorithm & PHPSecLib"
description: >-
  Configure custom signature algorithms and use PHPSecLib as an alternative to
  OpenSSL for Dashboard-to-Child communication.
---

MainWP Dashboard version 4.5 introduced the ability to set a custom signature algorithm and added PHPSecLib as an alternative to OpenSSL. Both options can be configured globally or on a per-site basis.

## What You'll Learn

- When to change the signature algorithm
- How to switch between OpenSSL and PHPSecLib
- How to configure these settings per site

## Prerequisites

- MainWP Dashboard version 4.5 or later
- Admin access to your Dashboard

## Signature Algorithm

### Background

MainWP uses digital signatures to verify communication between Dashboard and Child Sites. Previously, MainWP used SHA1 for signature verification. As hosts updated to OpenSSL 3, some disabled SHA1 as a legacy option.

MainWP now defaults to SHA256, which provides enhanced security and works with both OpenSSL 1 and OpenSSL 3.

### Change the Global Signature Algorithm

If your Dashboard host doesn't support a certain SHA algorithm, connections may fail.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Advanced Settings">
Go to **MainWP Dashboard > Settings > Advanced Settings**.
</Step>
<Step title="Select algorithm">
Find **OpenSSL signature algorithm** and select a supported algorithm.

</Step>
<Step title="Save settings">
Save your changes.
</Step>
</Steps>

Most hosts support SHA256. If yours doesn't, contact support to ask which algorithms they support.

<Note>
Signature verification happens after a site is added to the Dashboard. If verification fails, the site can still be added, but sync and other authenticated actions will fail.
</Note>

### Switching Back to SHA1

To switch from SHA256 to SHA1 (globally or for specific sites), you must reconnect affected child sites:

1. Visit each child site's WP Admin
2. Deactivate and reactivate the MainWP Child plugin (this disconnects it)
3. Reconnect the site from your Dashboard

## PHPSecLib as Alternative to OpenSSL

### When to Use PHPSecLib

PHPSecLib is a pure PHP implementation of cryptographic functions. Use it when:

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| OpenSSL unavailable | Server doesn't have OpenSSL installed |
| Configuration issues | OpenSSL misconfigured (common on localhost setups) |
| openssl.cnf problems | Cannot locate or configure the openssl.cnf file |

If OpenSSL works properly on your host (most web hosts), there's no need to switch to PHPSecLib.

### Enable PHPSecLib Globally

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Advanced Settings">
Go to **MainWP Dashboard > Settings > Advanced Settings**.
</Step>
<Step title="Change connection method">
Find **Verify connection method** and select **PHPSecLib**.

![Animation showing PHPSecLib selection in Verify connection method setting](/images/miscellaneous/advanced-custom-signature-algorithm-and-phpseclib-as-alternative-to-openssl.mdx-7da51c.gif)
</Step>
<Step title="Save settings">
Save your changes.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Changing to PHPSecLib globally requires re-adding existing child sites. To avoid this, configure the setting per site instead.
</Warning>

## Per-Site Settings

Both signature algorithm and connection method can be configured per site. This is useful when a specific child site's host has different requirements.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open site edit page">
Go to **MainWP Dashboard > Sites > Manage Sites**.
</Step>
<Step title="Select the site">
Click on the child site, then click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step title="Find Advanced Settings">
Scroll to the **Advanced Settings (Optional)** section.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure options">
Set the signature algorithm and/or verify connection method for this specific site.

</Step>
<Step title="Save changes">
Save the site settings.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Self-Check Checklist

- [ ] Identified whether connection issues are signature or OpenSSL related
- [ ] Selected appropriate signature algorithm for your host
- [ ] Configured PHPSecLib if OpenSSL is unavailable
- [ ] Child sites connecting and syncing successfully
