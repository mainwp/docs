title: How can I change the number of Simultaneous Sync Requests?
sidebarTitle: "Simultaneous Sync Requests"
description: >-
  Adjust the number of child sites MainWP syncs at once to balance speed and
  server resource usage.
---

MainWP syncs multiple child sites in parallel to speed up the process. The Maximum Simultaneous Sync Requests setting controls how many sites sync at once. Adjusting this value helps balance sync speed against server resources.

## What You'll Learn

- How to change the simultaneous sync limit
- When to increase or decrease this setting
- How to optimize for your server

## When to Adjust This Setting

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Sync operations are slow | Increase the value |
| Dashboard server is underpowered | Decrease the value |
| Hosting limits concurrent connections | Decrease the value |
| Child sites timeout during sync | Decrease the value |
| Fast server with many sites | Increase the value |

The default value works well for most installations. Adjust only if you experience performance issues.
