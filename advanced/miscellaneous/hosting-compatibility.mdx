  Hosting compatibility information for MainWP Dashboard and Child Sites,
  including recommended hosts and providers requiring additional configuration.
---

MainWP runs on standard WordPress hosting. If your host supports WordPress and meets the [system requirements](/advanced/miscellaneous/mainwp-system-requirements), MainWP will work. Performance scales with your server resources, so Dashboard sites managing many Child Sites benefit from adequate memory, CPU, and PHP execution time.

## What You'll Learn

- Recommended hosting providers for MainWP
- Hosts that require additional configuration
- How to address shared hosting limitations

## Recommended Hosts

These hosts offer WordPress-optimized environments that work well with MainWP:

## General Compatibility

MainWP has no inherent size or speed limits. Performance depends on your server's configuration and resources. A slow or underpowered server affects plugin performance just as it affects WordPress overall.

Before choosing a host:

1. Review the [MainWP System Requirements](/advanced/miscellaneous/mainwp-system-requirements)
2. Confirm the host meets [WordPress hosting requirements](https://wordpress.org/hosting/)
3. Check if the host allows required PHP functions (see [Required PHP Functions](/advanced/miscellaneous/required-php-functions-for-mainwp))

---

## Hosts Requiring Additional Configuration

Some hosting providers have security policies that require specific setup for MainWP to function properly:

| Host | Configuration Needed | Documentation |
|------|---------------------|---------------|
| WP Engine | Whitelist MainWP user agent for API access | [Deleting plugins on WP Engine](/troubleshooting/deleting-plugins-and-themes-not-working-on-the-wp-engine-hosted-child-sites-wp-engine-hosting) |
| Cloudways | Enable tmpfile() PHP function | [Enable tmpfile on Cloudways](/advanced/miscellaneous/enable-tmpfile-php-function-on-cloudways) |
| 20i | Whitelist MainWP Dashboard IP address | [Resolving 20i connection issues](/troubleshooting/how-to-resolve-issue-with-connecting-a-child-site-hosted-on-20i) |

---

## Shared Hosting Considerations

Shared hosting environments sometimes limit PHP functions or maximum run time. If you experience issues:

- Check if your host disables functions like `tmpfile()`, cURL functions, or `set_time_limit()`
- Request function access from hosting support (see [Required PHP Functions](/advanced/miscellaneous/required-php-functions-for-mainwp))
- Consider enabling [optimized data loading](/dashboard/overview/how-to-optimize-your-mainwp-dashboard-for-shared-hosting) for Dashboards managing 30+ sites

---

## Firewall and Security Plugins

Some hosts use web application firewalls (WAFs) that may block MainWP communication. If you have connection issues:

1. Check the [connection troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting/potential-issues)
2. Review the [ports and user agent](/troubleshooting/what-port-and-user-agent-does-mainwp-use) that MainWP uses
3. Whitelist the MainWP user agent in your security rules

---

## Self-Check Checklist

- [ ] Host meets MainWP system requirements
- [ ] Required PHP functions enabled
- [ ] No WAF blocking MainWP communication
- [ ] Adequate server resources for number of child sites
