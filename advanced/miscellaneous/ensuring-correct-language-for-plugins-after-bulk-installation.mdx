  Fix plugins showing in English after bulk installation when child sites use
  different languages by updating translations.

After bulk installing a plugin through MainWP Dashboard, the plugin may display in English even though the child site uses a different language. This happens because translation files aren't automatically fetched during remote installation.

## What You'll Learn

- How to update translations on individual child sites

## Why This Happens

When you install a plugin directly on a WordPress site, translations are automatically fetched from WordPress.org:

This automatic step doesn't occur when installing plugins remotely through MainWP Dashboard. The translation files must be fetched separately.

## Solution 1: Update Translations via MainWP

This approach updates translations for all affected sites at once.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the plugin">
Use MainWP Dashboard to bulk install the plugin.
</Step>
<Step title="Sync your Dashboard">
After installation, sync your MainWP Dashboard to detect the new plugin.
</Step>
<Step title="Navigate to Translation Updates">

Available translation updates for the newly installed plugin appear here. Apply these updates to ensure the plugin displays in the correct language on your child sites.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Solution 2: Update Translations on Child Sites

Use this approach if you need to update translations for specific sites.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the plugin">
Install the desired plugin via MainWP.
</Step>

## Best Practice

After any bulk plugin installation:

1. Sync your MainWP Dashboard
2. Check **MainWP > Updates > Translation Updates**

This ensures all plugins display in the correct language immediately.
