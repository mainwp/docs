  Third-party MainWP extensions are developed by other companies. Support for
  these extensions is provided by their developers.

Some MainWP extensions were developed by other companies and are labeled as **3rd Party extensions**. Support for third-party extensions is provided by their developers, not by MainWP.

## What You'll Learn

- Which extensions are developed by third parties
- Where to get support for each third-party extension

---

## Why MainWP Cannot Support Third-Party Extensions

MainWP does not provide support for third-party extensions because we don't have:

- The specialized training for each product
- Access to the source code
- Knowledge of the developer's implementation decisions

For the best support experience, contact the extension developer directly.
