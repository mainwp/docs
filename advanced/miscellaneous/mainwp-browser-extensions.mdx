MainWP browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox help you track available updates and manage your WordPress sites directly from your browser toolbar.

## What You'll Learn

- How to install the browser extension
- How to connect it to your Dashboard
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Prerequisites

- MainWP Dashboard on a web host (local installations not supported)
- Permalinks set to anything except "Plain"
- REST API access enabled

<Note>
The browser extension requires your MainWP Dashboard to be hosted on a web server. Locally hosted Dashboards are not compatible because REST API requests cannot reach local installations.
</Note>

---

## Features

- Track WordPress core, plugin, theme, and translation updates
- Automatically fetch update counts for all child sites
- Configure update check intervals
- Manually fetch update counts
- Track changes made outside your MainWP Dashboard
- Quick links to Dashboard pages for taking action

## Push Notifications

The extension sends browser notifications when it syncs. If you're not receiving notifications, check your operating system settings to ensure browser notifications are enabled.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Dashboard not accessible | Ensure Dashboard is on a web host (not localhost) |
| API errors | Set permalinks to something other than "Plain" |
| API key not working | Verify you clicked Save Settings after creating the key |
| Credentials rejected | Copy credentials to a text file first, then paste into extension |

### HTTP Basic Auth Conflict

The browser extension is not compatible with HTTP Basic Auth. Use the [Dashboard Lock extension](https://mainwp.com/extension/dashboard-lock/) instead, which provides equivalent protection without interfering with MainWP functionality.

### REST API Blocked

Security or performance plugins may block the REST API. Test by logging out and visiting:

```
https://your-dashboard-url.com/wp-json/
```

If you see an access denied message, find and adjust the blocking plugin's settings.

**Required REST API endpoints:**
- `/mainwp/v1/sites/all-sites`
- `/mainwp/v1/sites/sites-available-updates-count`
- `/mainwp/v1/site/non-mainwp-changes-count`

## Permissions and Privacy

The extension requests permissions for alarms, storage, and notifications to store update counts and notify you when you start your browser. The extension does not collect any user data—it only uses your generated REST API keys to connect to your Dashboard.

By installing, you agree to the [Terms of Service](https://mainwp.com/terms-of-service/) and [Privacy Policy](https://mainwp.com/privacy-policy/).
