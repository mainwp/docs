Some MainWP extensions require third-party plugins to be installed on your child sites. When you open an extension page, the Dashboard checks for missing required plugins and prompts you to install them.

## What You'll Learn

- How the required plugins check works
- How to install required plugins
- What happens if you dismiss the prompt

## How the Check Works

The required plugin check is triggered when you open an extension page (e.g., **Dashboard > Extensions > UpdraftPlus**).

If any required plugins are missing from your child sites, a popup modal appears with installation options.

## Installing Required Plugins

When the prompt appears, you have two options:

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Click **Install Plugin** | Installs and activates the required plugin on child sites |
| Click **Close** | Dismisses the prompt for 30 days |

<Note>
Installed plugins are automatically activated on child sites.
</Note>

---

## After Installation

After installing the required plugins, synchronize your Dashboard with child sites for the extension to detect the newly installed plugins.

Go to **MainWP > Sites > Manage Sites** and click **Sync Dashboard** or wait for the next automatic sync.

---

## Dismissed Prompt Timing

If you dismiss the modal by clicking **Close**, the next check for required plugins will occur no sooner than 30 days later.

To trigger an immediate check, deactivate and reactivate the extension, then open the extension page again.
