  Compatibility findings between MainWP and WordPress Multisite setups,
  including which features work and known limitations.
---

MainWP is not specifically designed for managing WordPress Multisite networks. However, many features work properly when connecting individual subsites to a MainWP Dashboard. This page documents our compatibility testing.

## What You'll Learn

- How to set up MainWP with Multisite subsites
- Which MainWP features work with Multisite
- Known limitations and behaviors

---

## Setup

Install the MainWP Child plugin in the standard `wp-content/plugins/` directory. You can activate it:

- **Network-wide**: From Network Settings panel for all subsites
- **Per-subsite**: Individually for specific subsites

As long as MainWP Child is active on a subsite, you can connect it to your MainWP Dashboard.

<Warning>
When adding subdomain URLs, do NOT include a leading `/` in the URL. Including it can result in a 403 Forbidden error. If this happens, use SFTP to delete the plugin, remove the subdomain sites from MainWP, and clear the server cache.
</Warning>

![MainWP Updates Management showing multisite plugin updates](/images/miscellaneous/advanced-miscellaneous-627b3e.jpg)

Updates are detected normally, with one important behavior to understand:

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Detection | One update displays as available on all subsites |
| Updating | Updating on any site applies to the entire network |
| Abandoned detection | Works normally, same behavior as updates |

### Content Management

Posts and pages work fully:

- Publishing content (including meta) works as expected
- Changing post/page status works
- Deleting posts/pages works

### Plugin & Theme Management

Installing and managing plugins/themes works, but changes affect the entire network:

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Install | Available on all network sites immediately |
| Activate/Deactivate | Works per-subsite |
| Delete | Removes from all network sites |

### User Management

| Action | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Create users | Partial | Fails if user already exists on another subsite |
| Delete users | Works | No issues |

## Key Considerations

Before using MainWP with Multisite:

1. **Network-wide changes**: Plugin and theme installations/deletions affect all subsites
2. **Duplicate updates**: The same update may appear multiple times (once per subsite)
3. **User limitations**: Creating users across subsites may fail if the username already exists
4. **Not officially supported**: While many features work, Multisite is not MainWP's primary use case

---

## Self-Check Checklist

- [ ] MainWP Child activated on target subsites
- [ ] Subdomain URLs entered without leading `/`
- [ ] Sites successfully syncing
- [ ] Understood that plugin/theme changes affect entire network
