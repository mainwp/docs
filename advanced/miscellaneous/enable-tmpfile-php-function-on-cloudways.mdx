Cloudways disables certain PHP functions by default for security. The `tmpfile()` function is one of these, and MainWP requires it for uploading plugins and themes via ZIP file.

## What You'll Learn

- How to identify if tmpfile() is disabled
- How to enable tmpfile() in Cloudways
- How to verify the change worked

## Prerequisites

- Cloudways account with access to Application Settings
- MainWP Dashboard installed on a Cloudways application

## When You Need This

Enable `tmpfile()` if you encounter:

- Plugin or theme uploads failing from your MainWP Dashboard
- "tmpfile() has been disabled" error messages
- ZIP file installations timing out or producing errors
- The Favorites extension unable to deploy plugins

## If Changes Don't Take Effect

If `tmpfile()` still appears disabled after saving:

3. Clear your browser cache and check Server Information again
4. Contact Cloudways support if the function remains disabled
