[Strattic](https://www.strattic.com/) is a solution for headless and static WordPress hosting. When a WordPress site is hosted on Strattic, it has three versions:

| Version | Purpose | MainWP Compatibility |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| Staging | WordPress administration (wp-admin) | Connect to MainWP using this URL |
| Preview | Review changes before publishing | Not used with MainWP |
| Live | Static public-facing site | Not accessible via MainWP |

MainWP connects only to the Staging version, which is the dynamic WordPress instance.

## Current Limitations

### Publishing Required After Changes

When you make changes through MainWP (updates, plugin installations, etc.), the Staging site is modified. These changes are not visible on your Live site until you publish.

Publishing generates a fresh static version of your site. See [Strattic's publishing documentation](https://support.strattic.com/en/articles/2574386-how-to-publish-to-static-with-strattic) for publishing options.

### Container Shutdown

After a period of inactivity on the Staging site, Strattic automatically shuts down the container for security and resource reasons.

| Impact | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| MainWP communication | Dashboard cannot sync or connect while container is down |
| Wake process | Currently only possible through Strattic dashboard |
| Live site | Completely unaffected by container shutdown |

Before performing MainWP operations, ensure the Strattic container is running by accessing the Staging site through the Strattic dashboard.
