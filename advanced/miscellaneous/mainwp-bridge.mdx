  MainWP Bridge handles secure Google authentication for the Google Analytics
  and Google Search Console extensions.
---

MainWP Bridge is a secure service operated by MainWP at `bridge.mainwp.com`. It handles Google authentication for the **Google Analytics** and **Google Search Console** extensions.

Bridge provides the **Sign in with Google** flow and manages the authorization process needed for MainWP to access reporting data from your Google account.

- How the authentication process works
- Data handling and privacy information

## What Bridge Does

Bridge is only used for authentication. It does **not** create or process analytics data—it only enables MainWP to securely access data that already exists in your Google accounts.

| Bridge handles | Bridge does NOT handle |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Sign in with Google flow | WordPress credentials |
| OAuth authorization | Child site data |
| Token refresh | Analytics or Search Console reports |

---

## Why Bridge Is Used

Connecting directly to Google requires OAuth applications, credentials, and regular token renewal. Bridge handles this complexity so you don't have to.

Bridge allows you to:

- Sign in with Google without creating your own Google Cloud OAuth app
- Keep Google authorization secure without storing OAuth secrets on your Dashboard
- Automatically refresh expired tokens so reports continue working

---

## How Bridge Works

### 1. One-Time Pairing

Before your first Google sign-in, your MainWP Dashboard pairs with Bridge:

1. Your Dashboard contacts Bridge to start the process
2. Bridge verifies it can reach your Dashboard URL to confirm ownership
3. Bridge generates a unique secret for secure communication

This pairing prevents unauthorized systems from requesting Google access on your behalf.

### 2. Sign in with Google

When you click **Sign in with Google**:

1. Your Dashboard requests a sign-in link from Bridge
2. A browser window opens on Google's sign-in page
3. You sign in and approve access

Your Google login details are entered only on Google's pages. MainWP never receives your Google password.

### 3. Authorization Stored on Dashboard

After approval:

1. Your Dashboard retrieves authorization tokens from Bridge
2. Tokens are stored locally on your Dashboard in encrypted form
3. You select which Analytics properties or Search Console sites to use

Your Dashboard then communicates directly with Google APIs using those tokens.

### 4. Automatic Token Refresh

Google access tokens expire regularly. When this happens:

1. Your Dashboard uses the secure pairing to request refreshed access through Bridge
2. If access can't be refreshed (e.g., revoked in Google), you'll be asked to sign in again

This happens in the background and keeps reports working.

### 5. Retrieving Data

Once connected:

- Your MainWP Dashboard pulls reporting data directly from Google
- Bridge is only used for authentication and token renewal
- Bridge does **not** process analytics data

---

## Data Handling and Privacy

### What Bridge Handles

During authentication, Bridge may receive:

- Your MainWP Dashboard URL (for pairing and verification)
- Authorization and session information for sign-in and token refresh

### What Bridge Does NOT Receive

- WordPress site credentials
- Child site data or content
- Analytics or Search Console reports

### What Your Dashboard Stores

- Encrypted Google authorization tokens
- Connected Google account identity
- Selected Analytics properties and Search Console sites
- Cached reporting data

### Permissions

Both extensions request **read-only** access. They display data in MainWP and do not change your Google Analytics or Search Console configuration.

## Requirements

For Bridge to work, your Dashboard must allow:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Outbound HTTPS | Access to `bridge.mainwp.com` |
| Google API access | Outbound HTTPS to Google API services |
| Browser popups | Enabled during Google sign-in |

During pairing, Bridge must be able to reach your Dashboard URL. Pairing may fail if your Dashboard:

- Is behind a firewall or IP restriction
- Is in maintenance mode
- Blocks WordPress REST API access

---

## Disconnect and Revoke Access

<Steps>
<Step title="Remove from extension">
Remove the account from the Google Analytics or Google Search Console extension settings.
</Step>
<Step title="Revoke in Google (optional)">
Revoke access from your [Google Account security settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).
</Step>
</Steps>

If you revoke access in Google, you'll need to sign in again to reconnect.

---

## Common Questions

**Does Bridge see my analytics or search data?**
No. Bridge is used for sign-in and authorization only. Reporting data is retrieved directly from Google.

**Why do I need to sign in again?**
This usually happens if access was revoked in Google, tokens expired and couldn't be refreshed, or the connection was interrupted.

---

## Alternative: Service Account (No Bridge)

If you can't use Bridge or prefer managing credentials yourself, both extensions support connecting via a **Google service account (JSON key file)**.

This method does not use Bridge but requires:
- Manual setup in Google Cloud Console
- Creating and downloading a service account key
- Assigning access to Analytics properties or Search Console sites
