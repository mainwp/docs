## Check If Functions Are Enabled

### Option 1: MainWP Server Information

Navigate to **MainWP > Info > Server**. This page displays your PHP configuration, including disabled functions.

### Option 2: PHP Info File

Create a temporary file on your server:

```php
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
```

Access it through your browser, then search for "disable_functions" to see which functions are blocked. Delete the file after checking.

### Option 3: Contact Hosting Support

Ask your host which functions are disabled and whether they can be enabled for your account.

## Symptoms of Disabled Functions

| cURL functions | Cannot add child sites, connection errors |
| `tmpfile` | ZIP uploads fail, plugin/theme installation errors |
| `imagepng` / `mb_internal_encoding` | Pro Reports PDF generation fails |
| `set_time_limit` | Bulk operations timeout on large networks |
| `bccomp` / `putenv` | Google Analytics data unavailable |

## Request Function Access

If your host has disabled required functions, contact their support. Here's a template:

> I'm using the MainWP WordPress management plugin, which requires certain PHP functions that appear to be disabled on my hosting account. Could you please enable the following functions for my account?
>
> - tmpfile (for plugin/theme uploads)
> - [list other functions you need]
>
> These are standard PHP functions used by many WordPress plugins and should not pose a security risk when used by legitimate software.

## Host-Specific Guides

Some hosts require specific steps to enable functions:

- [Enable tmpfile() on Cloudways](/advanced/miscellaneous/enable-tmpfile-php-function-on-cloudways)

If your host doesn't allow enabling these functions, consider a different hosting provider. See [Hosting Compatibility](/advanced/miscellaneous/hosting-compatibility) for recommended hosts.
