## Additional Requirements

For the Dashboard server:

- **Connection limit**: Increase the open file limit of the operating system if limited by host
- **Request handling**: Disable aborting request processing if users close the site (`ignore_user_abort` in php.ini)
- **PHP functions**: Ensure all [required PHP functions](/advanced/miscellaneous/required-php-functions-for-mainwp) are enabled

---

## Scaling for Network Size

As you add more child sites, your Dashboard server needs additional resources.

| Network Size | Hosting Type | Recommendations |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Up to 30 sites | Shared hosting | Standard shared plans work well |
| 31-100 sites | Reseller hosting | Additional server memory; enable "Optimize for Large Networks" in MainWP Settings |
| 100+ sites | VPS | At least 512MB PHP and WP memory; enable "Optimize for Large Networks" in MainWP Settings |

<Note>
The "Optimize for Large Networks" setting adjusts how MainWP loads data to reduce memory usage. Find it in **MainWP > Settings > Advanced Settings**.
</Note>

## Checking Your Configuration

You can verify your server meets requirements from within MainWP:

1. Go to **MainWP > Info > Server**
2. Review the displayed PHP and server settings
3. Check for any warnings or recommendations
