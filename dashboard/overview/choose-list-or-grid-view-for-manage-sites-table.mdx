description: Switch between list and grid layouts on the Manage Sites page to display your child sites in your preferred format.

The Manage Sites page offers two display options: list view and grid view. List view shows sites in a traditional table format with sortable columns. Grid view displays sites as visual cards, which can be useful when managing sites by visual recognition or when you prefer a more compact layout.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a MainWP Dashboard site
- At least one connected child site

## When to Use Each View

- **List view**: Best for sorting, filtering, and comparing site details across multiple columns
- **Grid view**: Best for quick visual scanning and when you recognize sites by their appearance

Your view preference persists until you change it again.
