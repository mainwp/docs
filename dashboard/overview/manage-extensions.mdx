## What are the MainWP Add-ons

[MainWP Add-ons](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-add-ons/) are composed of PHP scripts that extend the functionality of your [MainWP Dashboard](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp/). They offer new additions to your Dashboard that either enhance features that were already available or add new features to your Dashboard.

MainWP offers a variety of [Free](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-add-ons/add-ons-category/free/) and Premium Add-ons in multiple categories, which can be acquired by signing up for one of [MainWP Pro Plans](https://mainwp.com/signup/).

-   [Administrative Add-ons](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-add-ons/add-on-category/administrative/)
-   [Backup Add-ons](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-add-ons/add-on-category/backups/)
-   [Content Add-ons](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-add-ons/add-on-category/content/)
-   [Performance Add-ons](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-add-ons/add-on-category/performance/)
-   [Security Add-ons](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-add-ons/add-on-category/security/)
-   [Analytics Add-ons](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-add-ons/add-on-category/analytics/)

After signing up for a MainWP Pro Plan, you will be provided with the Main API Key for Add-ons Activation and a Download Link for your purchased product(s).

Even though all MainWP Add-ons are fully functional without API Activation, support and automated updates are available only for activated Add-ons.

If you want to develop your Add-ons, there is a comprehensive list of resources at [MainWP Codex](https://mainwp.dev/).

**Please note**: MainWP Add-ons are distinct from the MainWP plugins. The Add-ons are delivered through our Add-on system, while the plugins are delivered through wordpress.org repository. The free plugins include: [MainWP Child,](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp-child/) [MainWP Dashboard](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp/), [MainWP Child Reports](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp-child-reports/), and [MainWP Key Maker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp-key-maker/).

</Step>
<Step title="Go to the MainWP > Add-ons page">

## Update Add-ons

### Automatic Add-on(s) Update

In order to receive Automatic Updates, Add-on API Activation is required!

</Step>
<Step title="Find the Add-on that needs to be updated">
</Step>
<Step title="Press the Update Now link">
</Step>
</Steps>


### Manual Add-on(s) Update

Reinstallation of a MainWP Add-on(s) does not remove any data from a database. This means that if you reinstall your Add-on to update it, Add-on settings won’t be lost.

<Steps>
<Step title="Download the latest version of the Add-on(s) you wish to update">
</Step>
<Step title="Login into your MainWP Dashboard site">
</Step>
<Step title="Go to the WP > Plugins page">
</Step>
<Step title="Find the Add-on you want to update">
</Step>
<Step title="Deactivate it">
</Step>
<Step title="Delete it">
</Step>
<Step title="Install the new version">
</Step>
</Steps>


It is crucial to update MainWP Add-ons as soon as an update is available. Using out of date Add-ons can cause a variety of issues, the two biggest ones being **Security and Compatibility.**

## Remove Unneeded Add-ons

Since MainWP Dashboard version 4.3, MainWP Add-ons can be removed directly from the MainWP Dashboard.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to MainWP Dashboard > Add-ons page">
</Step>
<Step title="Find the Add-on you wish to remove">
</Step>
<Step title="Click the Disable button">
</Step>
<Step title="After the page refreshes, click the Delete button">
After the page refreshes, click the Delete button  
    
</Step>
</Steps>


Add-ons can also be removed like any other WordPress plugin. To remove Add-ons in that manner:

<Steps>
<Step title="Login to your MainWP Dashboard site">
</Step>
<Step title="Go to the WP Admin > Plugins page">
</Step>
<Step title="Find the Add-on(s) you wish to remove">
</Step>
<Step title="Deactivate it">
</Step>
<Step title="Delete it">
</Step>
